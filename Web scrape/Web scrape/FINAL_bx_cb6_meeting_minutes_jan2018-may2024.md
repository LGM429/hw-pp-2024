Because of its long crossing distances, unprotected bike lanes and speeding encouraged by its\nwide roadway, this area impedes pedestrian safety. DOT proposes to create bus boarding islands and safer bike\nlanes, etc. By doing so, this will improve the speed of buses, bus stop accessibility, shorter crossing distances,\nimprovement of pedestrian crossing and bicycle safety.

Lastly, the Corona Virus is affecting worldwide with only a few cases in the U.S., but it is\nheaded this way. How can the community board help? We can help by keeping people informed and educating\nthem. Let’s keep people focused on facts and recommend that they visit the Department of Health’s website and\ndownload and share the fact sheet.

The topic was the Permanent Open Restaurants Text Amendment.\n\n            - A robust discussion occurred. The subject was on the floor for about an hour. The\n\nBoard noted that the Economic Development Committee was only given a week to\nreview—an inadequate amount of time to provide thoughtful input and ask questions.\n\n            - The motion to approve the text amendment carried: 22 in favor; 6 opposed; 4\n\nabstentions. It was duly noted that the text had already been approved by City Council\nthus underscoring the fact that CB4 did not have time to truly offer counsel.\n\n            - Background in short:\n\n`o` The City Planning Commission is planning on voting on the zoning text\n\namendment at the beginning of October.\n\n`o` The resolution in front of CB4 had to do with sidewalk seating only.\n`o` The presentation concerned: 1) the text amendment to remove the restrictions\n\nin the zoning resolution for open dining on the sidewalks; and 2) a preliminary\ndiscussion about what a permanent open restaurant program will look like,\nboth on sidewalks, and in the roadway.\n\n`o` Background: Over 11,000 restaurants were granted permits for either sidewalk\n\nor roadway dining city wide. And this helped save an estimated 100,000 jobs\nthroughout the city.\n\n`o` The City Council voted in 2020 to establish a permanent outdoor dining\n\nprogram.\n\nPage 4 of 6\n\n\n-----\n\n`o` Their vision for the program is that it would be administered by DOT\n\ncompletely; DOT would be the sole agency accepting and vetting applications as\nwell as enforcing the rules. They think the introduction of the roadway option is\na new opportunity for restaurants, especially those who may have narrow\nsidewalks.\n\n                  - There will be no roadway seating allowed in the wintertime.\n\n                  - They think it will take at least a year and a half to develop new rules.\n\n                  - While they are developing the new rules, the current emergency\n\nprogram will be in effect for another year and a half.\n\n`o` Zoning proposal\n\n                  - The removal of the zoning text amendment would allow them to expand\n\nthe universe of sidewalk cafes throughout the city.\n\n                  - They currently have a total of 49 active permits in CB4, mostly\n\nconcentrated along 161[st] Street, 167[th] Street, and Jerome Avenue.\n\n                  - 14 of these restaurants would have not been legal before COVID\n\nbecause they were prohibited in the zoning resolution, and another 6\nwould have been prohibited because they were residential\nneighborhoods.\n\n10.

What would be best to alleviate traffic on\nCVW?\n\n - Request a LOS to move further with the study.\n\n - Congestion of CVW from E. 153[rd] Street to E. 161[st] Street\n\n`o` Pedestrian safety\n`o` Future development\n\n - Roadway direction\n\n`o` Presently, all cars go E. 159[th] Street or E. 161[st]\n`o` Too narrow to be a two-way roadway\n\n - _Proposed Changes_\n\n`o` Traffic Counts\n`o` Evaluate needs of local schools\n`o` Talk to community members\n`o` Provide multiple outlets for CVW\n\n  - _Summary Proposal of Study_\n\n`o` E. 153[rd] Street go one way Eastbound between Grand Concourse (GC) and CVW\n`o` E. 156[th] Street two-way roadway – go both East and West between GC and CVW\n`o` Convert E. 156[th] Street between Grand & Morris Avenue into one way Eastbound\n`o Convert E 158[th]` Street to a two-way roadway\n\n\n-----\n\nPros: provide multiple outlets out of CVW and remove the head on conflicts that exist at E. 156 St\n\nCons: In order to allow two-way traffic on E. 156[th] Street, will have to take away parking on one side of the\nroadway. DOT will study as part of this and will work with the community to evaluate and understand\ntheir concerns.  The study will be brought to the community board in the fall.\n\nLocal vehicle access on E. 156[th] Street between CVW and GC would have to go via CVW. It cannot go\nWest bound. They will evaluate the traffic impact associated with the proposed changes.\n\nThe benefits are that there will be a lot of extra channelization/roadway markings on the GC which will\ncreate a lot of space. Therefore, they would like to fit some angle parking spaces there. This would allow\nsome parking back to the community. This is to be determined by the study.\n\nCommunity members can send their photos of the area and concerns to [marancio@dot.nyc.gov that they](mailto:marancio@dot.nyc.gov)\nfeel will help the study. Ms. Beverly Bond motioned to grant a LOS to move forward with the study of\ntraffic at CVW. It was seconded by Ms. Veronique Green. It was a unanimous vote to grant a LOS. The\n**motion carries.**\n\n**Presentation: Program Overview of JUMP Bikes, Kyle Thomas-Senior Operations Manager.**\nJUMP came to the Board to request a LOS to expand the current dockless e-bike sharing in other areas in the\nBronx. JUMP was created to provide equitable, reliable, healthy and fun transportation to everyone across all\ncities and internationally. It is a pedal less bike with a battery it that gives you a boost when you start pedaling.\nIt opens doors for people who have shied away from biking because of physical limitations. The dockless is\ndifferent from the Citibike system in that you do not have to get at a dock which would take away parking spots.\nIt can be left at any bike rack on any city street. It was launched on July 2018 in the Bronx and Staten Island. It\nwas given the ability to have 200 bikes in each of those two zones. There are over a third of users using it two to\nthree times per week. The average us is two miles or 20 minutes. It is usually used at transportation hubs or\nparks on the weekends. The cost to use is $2 for 30 minus and .7¢ per minute after that. Additionally, there is a\nBoost Program for people on SNAP, PA and NYCHA for $5 per month for a one hour use per day. The JUMP\npilot program is set to end in late August. Staten Island has acquired an RVI to continue its program, but the\nprogram in the Bronx is set to be discontinued. They are trying to prevent a shut down in the Bronx. JUMP is\ncommitted 100% to expand in the Bronx. There warehouse is located in the area of Southern Boulevard with\nmany of the workers from the Bronx. They are asking for a LOS to continue their services in all areas of the\nBronx. Ms. Genny Sanchez motioned to continue the JUMP Bikes Program in the Bronx. It was seconded by\nMr. Harris.

Discussion/Overview: Bronx Parking Development Company, LLC (BPDC) restructuring and proposed lease**\n**severance agreement**\n\n  - Waheera Mardah, Jamie Horton, and Nate Gray from the NYC Economic Development Corporation; and Wendy\nGallegos and Jorge Madruge from MADDD Equities LLC presented and took questions from board members.\n\n  - Background:\n\n`o` The 2006 Yankee Stadium Redevelopment Project included the construction of a new Yankee Stadium\none block to the north of the old stadium, construction of four new parking garages (subsequently\nreduced to three new garages in 2007), and the construction of new and replacement park facilities in\nthe area around the new stadium.\n\n`o` The new stadium, which has a capacity for approximately 54,000 spectators (53,000 seats and 1,000\nstanding spaces), replaced the previous 82-year-old Yankee Stadium, which had approximately 56,928\nseats, and had become outdated and did not meet modern standards.\n\n`o` NYCEDC and the City of New York are seeking the approval of the Bronx Borough Board under Section\n384(b)(4) of the City Charter to approve a severance of the existing lease (the “BPDC Lease”) between\nthe City and Bronx Parking Development Company, LLC (“BPDC”), into a Severance Lease and a Balance\nLease which would have revised business terms that are more favorable to the City.\n\n`o` The BPDC Lease was entered into in 2007 and has a term of 99 years (including extensions) and covers\nfive garages and eight lots on City-owned land in the area around Yankee Stadium (the “Leased\nPremises”).\n\n`o` This 384(b)(4) approval is essential to resolving a long-standing default of the tax-exempt bonds secured\nby the BPDC Lease and restructuring the BPDC Lease on terms that are more beneficial to the City.\n\n`o` The 384(b)(4) approval is required to create the opportunity for any potential future redevelopment of\nthese underutilized properties into more productive, community-serving uses.\n\n`o` It is important to note that this 384(b)(4) approval, which is needed to effect the severance and\nrestructuring of business terms of the BPDC Lease, will not alter the current use of the six parking lots\nand five garages that comprise the Yankee Stadium Parking System (“YSPS”)1, which will remain\nrestricted to parking uses and the same parking facilities will serve Yankee Stadium patrons on Stadium\nevent days.\n\nPage 3 of 7\n\n\n-----\n\n`o` Any change to the restricted use (which is currently for parking only within the YSPS), would require\nadditional processes, including another 384(b)(4) approval.\n\n`o` For more background, see the Conditions Responses and BPDC History Memo that were distributed\nprior to the board meeting.\n\n  - Questions from board members concerning upfront acquisition payments (approx. $50MM for the severance),\nthe bankruptcy process, general transparency going forward, commitments made with South Bronx\nCommunity Ventures, financial administrative flows, fair market value of the lots, among other topics were\naddressed.\n\n  - Other takeaways:\n\n`o` The lots are encumbered by $230MM of debt.\n`o` The city is waiving the accrued rent and pilot. Going forward EDC is taking a senior position in the new\nlease, so that that won't happen again.\n\n`o` Rent payments typically go into the city’s general fund.\n`o` There are currently no specific plans to spend rent payments in Community District 4.\n\n**8.

Grant Highway at 167[th]/168[th] streets which is a vision\nzero priority area. Because of its long crossing distances, unprotected bike lanes and speeding encouraged by its\nwide roadway, this area impedes pedestrian safety. DOT proposes to create bus boarding islands and safer bike\nlanes, etc. By doing so, this will improve the speed of buses, bus stop accessibility, shorter crossing distances,\nimprovement of pedestrian crossing and bicycle safety. However, there will be a loss of 6-20 parking spots. The\ncommittee also had a presentation requesting a Letter of Support for the design and construction of a new FDNY\nEMS headquarters at 1257 Morris Avenue between 167[th] & 169[th] Street.

This new facility will be the\nrestocking station for the ambulance supplies, it will be open 24 hours and it holds 11 units. It will provide 24\nparking spots; therefore, they will not use any residential parking. The construction will take approximately two\nto three years to complete. At committee, it was voted unanimously to grant a Letter of Support. They will\ncome back to committee at a later time with proposed renderings of the design and construction. The Committee\nmotioned to provide a LOS for the design and construction of an EMS Headquarters at 1251 Morris Avenue. It\nwas seconded by Dr. Grace Zarate.

Additionally, the Norwood at Dekalb Avenue will also be opened all year\nround on Thursdays. The committee continued their discussion on the District Needs Statement and they are\nasking for a comprehensive health center in view of the very high number of people coming into the community.\nWe are lacking services and currently only Lincoln Hospital and BronxCare hospital are available along with a\nfew scattered clinics. Lastly, the Corona Virus is affecting worldwide with only a few cases in the U.S., but it is\nheaded this way. How can the community board help? We can help by keeping people informed and educating\nthem. Let’s keep people focused on facts and recommend that they visit the Department of Health’s website and\ndownload and share the fact sheet. It is recommended that people wash their hands. This is very important in\norder to control the spread. Seek medical attention if they develop a cough and/or a fever. The corona virus has\nbeen named by the World Health Organization (WHO) as COVID-19.\n**Youth Services & Education – The committee didn’t have any voting items. They had two presentations.

We will bring it forward\nto the Executive Committee and will discuss it in order to see if an amendment is necessary. The Committee\nvoted to approve the By-Laws with any necessary corrections as issued. Said motion was seconded by Mrs.\nZonia Ortiz.
