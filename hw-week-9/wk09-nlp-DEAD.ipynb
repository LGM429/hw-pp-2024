      "\n",
      "    Senator Carper. Good morning. Let me call this hearing to \n",
      "order.\n",
      "    We are here today to examine the implementation of the \n",
      "Drinking Water and Wastewater portions of the Bipartisan \n",
      "Infrastructure Law. As you will recall, this historic \n",
      "bipartisan law is helping to deliver clean drinking water to \n",
      "millions of households and schools across our country.\n",
      "    Before we do that, let me start by saying how grateful I am \n",
      "to both panels of witnesses that are joining us today, \n",
      "including representatives of drinking water, clean water, as \n",
      "well as small and large utilities. We are particularly \n",
      "appreciative that Assistant Administrator Radhika Fox, who \n",
      "leads EPA's Office of Water, has joined us.\n",
      "    Welcome.\n",
      "    To all of our guests; we have a lot of folks, Senator \n",
      "Capito, I don't think we have had that many photos before a \n",
      "hearing in a long time. We want to remember this day.\n",
      "    Yesterday, the Biden administration took a major step in \n",
      "addressing the presence of toxic forever chemicals known as \n",
      "PFAS in our drinking water. This announcement was some 20 years \n",
      "in the making. It is an issue that is very important to, as it \n",
      "turns out, to West Virginia and to Delaware, and frankly, to \n",
      "all the other 48 States across the country. I want to commend \n",
      "the President; I want to commend Administrator Regan, Assistant \n",
      "Administrator Fox, and all of EPA for proposing a thoughtful, \n",
      "science based, national drinking water standard for PFAS.\n",
      "    This critical step to protecting our drinking water comes \n",
      "on top of the President calling for significant investments to \n",
      "protect our public health and environment in his proposed 2024 \n",
      "budget released last week. In his budget, the President \n",
      "requested more than $12 billion for EPA, $1.9 billion, a 19 \n",
      "percent increase from the 2023 enacted level. More than $4 \n",
      "billion of that proposal is reserved for water infrastructure. \n",
      "That includes an additional $219 million for grants to reduce \n",
      "the amount of lead in drinking water, to test for and remove \n",
      "lead in schools, and to replace lead pipes.\n",
      "    This budget builds on the Committee's work in the \n",
      "Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to invest in our nation's water \n",
      "infrastructure, which brings us to the topic of today's \n",
      "hearing: Oversight of the implementation of the drinking water \n",
      "and wastewater portions of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n",
      "    As we have discussed, Democrats and Republicans on this \n",
      "panel, it is not just enough to enact landmark legislation like \n",
      "this, but it is important that it be appropriately implemented \n",
      "and that we exercise our responsibilities with respect to \n",
      "oversight. That is part of what we are doing here today.\n",
      "    Our work on this Committee to improve our water \n",
      "infrastructure is personal to me. We have some folks here from \n",
      "West Virginia who have joined us; welcome.\n",
      "    If you're from West Virginia, raise your hand. If you would \n",
      "like to be from West Virginia, raise your hand.\n",
      "    [Laughter.]\n",
      "    Senator Carper. Almost everybody, for the record.\n",
      "    Our work in this Committee is to improve our water and \n",
      "infrastructure. As I said, it is personal to me, rooted in my \n",
      "faith and my family's history in Raleigh County, West Virginia. \n",
      "Some of you may recall that Matthew 25 calls on all of us to \n",
      "actually care for those that are in need, the least of these, \n",
      "to give those that are thirsty something to drink. For me, this \n",
      "includes that ensuring that Americans have access to clean, \n",
      "safe, and reliable water services.\n",
      "    Some of you may recall, I was born in Beckley, in a coal \n",
      "mining town in the southern part of the State. For 2 of those 6 \n",
      "years that we actually lived there, my first 6 years of my \n",
      "life, we lived alongside a stream. Our Ranking Member has heard \n",
      "of Beaver; she's been to Beaver right outside of Beckley many \n",
      "times. There is a creek that goes through there called Beaver \n",
      "Creek. My sister and I lived alongside Beaver Creek.\n",
      "    We would play along the banks of that creek. We would try \n",
      "to catch small fish, sometimes frogs, and we were never allowed \n",
      "to eat any of them. Nor were we allowed to drink the water from \n",
      "Beaver Creek. That is because many of the nearby septic tanks \n",
      "were not well maintained, and as a result raw sewage and other \n",
      "pollution could seep into that creek. At the time, our \n",
      "situation was not too different from that of many other small \n",
      "communities in West Virginia and across the country.\n",
      "    In the years that followed, our Government has responded to \n",
      "this water crisis by creating grant and later loan programs \n",
      "that made it easier for communities across our country to build \n",
      "and upgrade drinking water and wastewater treatment systems. \n",
      "Over time, these programs languished and were in dire need of \n",
      "updating.\n",
      "    That is why I, along with our Ranking Member, Senator \n",
      "Capito, Senator Cardin, Senator Lummis, Senator Duckworth, \n",
      "Senator Cramer, and many other members of this Committee and \n",
      "off this Committee joined forces to address this need. We \n",
      "worked in an overwhelmingly bipartisan way to draft the \n",
      "Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act. You will \n",
      "recall that our legislation included historic investments in \n",
      "EPA's State Revolving Funds. Those funds were the primary \n",
      "vehicle for State and local governments to finance water \n",
      "infrastructure projects throughout America.\n",
      "    We advanced our legislation out of Committee unanimously \n",
      "and later passed it out of the full Senate by a vote of 89 to \n",
      "2. If the American people are looking for bipartisanship, they \n",
      "need look no further than this Committee and its work on \n",
      "infrastructure. This water bill, combined with our Committee's \n",
      "historic highway legislation, roads, highways, bridges, served \n",
      "as the foundation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which \n",
      "President Biden signed into law in November 2021, a happy day \n",
      "for all of us.\n",
      "    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invested an unprecedented \n",
      "$55 billion, $55 billion, that's billion with a B, to improve \n",
      "drinking water and wastewater systems in communities across our \n",
      "country, and it was paid for, fully offset. This remains the \n",
      "single largest water infrastructure investment in our nation's \n",
      "history. Let me repeat that: This remains the single largest \n",
      "water infrastructure investment in our nation's history. Now, \n",
      "EPA has the responsibility of putting these dollars, these \n",
      "investments, to work for all of the American people.\n",
      "    Today's hearing is an opportunity to gain a deeper \n",
      "understanding of how this process is going. This hearing will \n",
      "allow us to explore future opportunities to improve the way we \n",
      "invest in our drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. \n",
      "That includes investigating how the Bipartisan Infrastructure \n",
      "Law programs are benefiting communities with the greatest need \n",
      "and what additional authorities or changes might be needed to \n",
      "make the program function better.\n",
      "    I like to say, everything I do, I know I can do better. And \n",
      "as proud as we are of this legislation, we know that we can \n",
      "still improve on it further. For example, is there more that \n",
      "could be done to adapt these programs to changes in our climate \n",
      "and our population and the age of our infrastructure?\n",
      "    As I said earlier, we look forward to hearing from our \n",
      "distinguished panels of witnesses today. Before we do, let me \n",
      "turn to Senator Capito for her opening remarks.\n",

      "small, rural, and disadvantaged communities.\n",
      "    In this hearing, we will explore the current state of our \n",

      "disadvantaged communities, funding for lead service line \n",

      "contaminants like PFAS that require specialized treatment \n",
      "technologies. At the same time, small, rural, and disadvantaged \n",
      "communities often lack the resources and technical expertise \n",
      "needed to address these challenges, leaving us very vulnerable \n",
      "to water quality problems and public health risks.\n",
      "    IIJA programs offer a wide range of funding opportunities \n",

      "putting a strain on our systems. So we need to help there. We \n",
      "need to help communities build the expertise needed to manage \n",

      "    Despite these significant funding challenges, ongoing unmet \n",
      "needs in small, rural, and disadvantaged communities still \n",
      "remain a concern. As they have said, they lack some of the \n",

      "am so honored to join you to provide an update on EPA's \n",
      "implementation of historic water infrastructure investments \n",
      "through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n",
      "    Really, I just need to start by saying thank you. It really \n",
      "is the bipartisan leadership of this Committee that was so \n",
      "instrumental in securing over $50 billion to invest in clean \n",
      "and safe water in communities across America.\n",
      "    I also want to take a moment to express my gratitude to the \n",
      "incredible career staff at EPA who are really the ones \n",
      "implementing this. I have some of the leadership from the \n",
      "Office of Groundwater and Drinking Water here with me today. It \n",
      "is really because of their dedication, their technical \n",
      "expertise, their hard work that we are delivering on the \n",
      "Bipartisan Infrastructure Law as promised to the American \n",
      "people.\n",
      "    So let me give you a brief report out on how implementation \n",
      "is going at the EPA. Congress provided the majority of the \n",
      "water funding through the State Revolving Loan Funds program, \n",
      "the SRFs, about $43 billion. In March 2022, EPA issued our SRF \n",
      "implementation memo. That document established key priorities \n",
      "consistent with the legislation that has really been our north \n",
      "star for how we have been implementing this bill.\n",
      "    The key priorities that we outlined in that SRF \n",
      "implementation memo were, one, to provide flexibility to States \n",
      "in meeting their local water needs, increasing investment in \n",
      "disadvantaged communities, making rapid progress on lead \n",
      "service line replacements, addressing PFAS and other emerging \n",
      "contaminants, advancing climate adaptation and mitigation, and \n",
      "supporting good jobs here in America.\n",
      "    We engaged very closely with the States as we developed \n",
      "this implementation memo. We have a State SRF work group. And \n",
      "that has really set the foundation for a robust partnership \n",
      "with the States in implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure \n",
      "Law.\n",
      "    So here we are about 1 year later, and I am delighted to \n",
      "report that 47 States and six Tribes and territories have \n",
      "received nearly $5 billion in SRF funding in the first year. \n",
      "That is a big number, and I want to talk for a minute about \n",
      "what that means for people and for local communities.\n",
      "    For example, because of these investments, Sierra Vista RV \n",
      "Park in Arizona will be able to remove arsenic and nitrates \n",
      "from their drinking water. Local government leaders in Sussex \n",
      "County, Delaware, will be able to connect hundreds of homes to \n",
      "a regional water system, which will also protect nearby marshes \n",
      "along the Delaware Bay. And in Pittsburgh, we are going to \n",
      "remove nearly 1,000 lead pipes in low income and working class \n",
      "neighborhoods.\n",
      "    Those are just a couple of examples of the thousands of \n",
      "projects that are going to be funded by the SRFs. That is the \n",
      "real deal that we are delivering to America because of the \n",
      "Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n",
      "    Let me touch on a couple of other highlights. The \n",
      "Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also established the Emerging \n",
      "Contaminants and Smaller Disadvantaged Communities Grant \n",
      "Program. Just a few weeks ago, we announced the first $2 \n",
      "billion funding available through that on a non-competitive \n",
      "basis available to all the States that want those resources. \n",
      "Very excited about that.\n",
      "    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is also investing nearly \n",
      "$2 billion through the agency's Geographic National Estuary and \n",
      "Gulf Hypoxia programs. These investments are so wonderful. They \n",
      "are supporting conservation, restoration, infrastructure \n",
      "programs to protect some of our nation's most treasured waters, \n",
      "the Chesapeake Bay, the Great Lakes, the Mississippi River \n",
      "Basin, the Gulf of Mexico, the San Francisco Bay, really just \n",
      "quite remarkable.\n",
      "    We are also working, because of the Bipartisan \n",
      "Infrastructure Law, to ensure that our groundwater is safe. We \n",
      "are providing $50 million to help States develop and implement \n",
      "underground injection control classics program to support \n",
      "carbon capture and sequestration. We have a letter of inquiry \n",
      "on that process underway, where States can seek these resources \n",
      "if they want primacy of the program. We are going to be \n",
      "awarding funds to States by the end of this year.\n",
      "    I want to conclude my remarks by emphasizing something that \n",
      "both you, Senator Capito, and Senator Carper said, and that is \n",
      "that we are really dedicated to ensuring that all communities \n",
      "benefit from this investment. We know there are too many small \n",
      "communities, too many rural communities, too many underserved \n",
      "urban distressed areas that have not received their fair share \n",
      "of Federal funding. We can and we must do better. That is our \n",
      "focus at EPA.\n",
      "    In addition to all of the work to get these resources out \n",
      "to States and local communities, we have been standing up the \n",
      "most significant technical assistance program, because we think \n",
      "that is what will change the odds for communities who haven't \n",
      "been able to get their fair share. We are actively working in \n",
      "communities across the country from McDowell County, West \n",
      "Virginia, to Lowndes County, Alabama, to communities all across \n",
      "the country. We have 29 environmental finance centers who are \n",
      "providing free technical assistance to communities that want \n",
      "it. We have our Closing the Wastewater Access Gap initiative, \n",
      "we have our Lead Service Line Accelerators.\n",
      "    All of these technical assistance programs are helping \n",
      "build that local community capacity to make sure we are \n",
      "unlocking these resources for every community, so that every \n",
      "community has clean and safe water.\n",
      "    Let me end where I began, which is to say thank you. Thank \n",
      "you so much for the opportunity to steward these resources. It \n",
      "is because of Congress and President Biden that you have \n",
      "created a transformational moment right now, a transformational \n",
      "opportunity for the water sector. I want you to know that EPA \n",
      "is working hard, we are working strategically to deliver on the \n",
      "vision that you set in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. We \n",
      "are working to make sure that water funding benefits all \n",
      "Americans, no matter where they live, how much money they have \n",
      "in their bank account, or the color of their skin.\n",
      "    I want to thank you again for the opportunity to serve the \n",
      "American people in this way. I look forward to today's \n",
      "discussion. Thank you.\n",
      "    [The prepared statement of Ms. Fox follows:]\n",
      "    \n",
      "[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Senator Carper. Thank you very much for being here today, \n",
      "and for your leadership, and the hard work that has been done \n",
      "and is being done within EPA especially on these issues.\n",
      "    Again, we want to say to our staffs who are sitting behind \n",
      "us and those who are back in their offices how much we \n",
      "appreciate their work on these issues as well.\n",
      "    Senator Capito, my Ranking Member here, I want to say again \n",
      "how proud I was of our Committee last week with our hearing on \n",
      "the derailment in East Palestine. I thought it was a wonderful \n",
      "hearing, and bipartisan and penetrating and something that sets \n",
      "the stage for making sure that the people of East Palestine and \n",
      "that part of America are treated the way we would want to be \n",
      "treated. I am very, very proud, and thank you for all of that.\n",
      "    Let me start with some questions, if I can, for Ms. Fox. We \n",
      "have mentioned PFAS a time or two in today's hearing. I want to \n",
      "return to it. EPA yesterday released, as we know, the proposed \n",
      "drinking water standard for six types of PFAS chemicals. I want \n",
      "to commend you and Administrator Regan for your leadership in \n",
      "proposing a standard that is based in science and a standard \n",
      "that protects the public to the maximum extent possible.\n",
      "    These forever chemicals are prolific throughout the \n",
      "environment. Under President Biden's leadership, EPA has taken \n",
      "another significant step to address their presence in our water \n",
      "with yesterday's decision.\n",
      "    Question: Ms. Fox, can you please give us some more \n",
      "background on the standard and explain the next step for the \n",
      "agency's action in this regard?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. Thank you for the question, Senator. I want to \n",
      "thank you and Senator Capito and other members of this \n",
      "Committee who have kept us focused on getting this drinking \n",
      "water standard proposed. I was talking to Senator Capito \n",
      "yesterday, and said, in the 2 years that we have had \n",
      "conversations, I don't think there is a single time that we \n",
      "spoke where you don't ask about this. We are really, truly \n",
      "thrilled to be at this key milestone.\n",
      "    The science on PFAS is clear. Exposure, even at very low \n",
      "levels, is very harmful to human health. What we also know \n",
      "about the science is that people are exposed to PFAS from a \n",
      "variety of means, from their air, their land, and their water. \n",
      "But when PFAS is in drinking water, we know it is one of the \n",
      "most significant contributors to the harmful health effects \n",
      "that people face. So as we think about making progress on this \n",
      "critical issue for the American people, having a national \n",
      "drinking water standard that keeps PFAS out of our drinking \n",
      "water, that is one of the best things that we can do as a \n",
      "nation from a human health perspective.\n",
      "    We are very proud of the proposal that we announced \n",
      "yesterday. It is based in the latest peer reviewed science, and \n",
      "science is evolving rapidly as it relates to PFAS. It is \n",
      "grounded in the latest peer reviewed science. It also learned \n",
      "from the dozen States that already have established MCLs for \n",
      "PFAS in drinking water.\n",
      "    As you said, Senator, the proposal calls for regulating six \n",
      "PFAS. We are proposing to set an MCL, maximum contaminant \n",
      "level, of four parts per trillion for PFOA and PFOS. Four parts \n",
      "per trillion is the level at which we can detected PFAS in our \n",
      "drinking water. We have laboratory capacity to do that.\n",
      "    We also are proposing to regulate four additional PFAS as a \n",
      "mixture. These four PFAS are known to co-occur in drinking \n",
      "water. This is GENX, PFES, PFNX, PFE, an alphabet soup of PFAS. \n",
      "But with those four, we are setting a hazard index for those \n",
      "four PFAS.\n",
      "    Also, some of the other features of the rule proposal that \n",
      "we are very pleased with is the public notification \n",
      "requirements, which is so important, so that the American \n",
      "people can know. We have developed a flexible approach to \n",
      "monitoring and compliance, recognizing that water systems are \n",
      "in different places.\n",
      "    The next steps are a 60 day comment period. So we are very \n",
      "much looking forward to engaging with our State co-regulators, \n",
      "local water systems, community organizations, to get feedback \n",
      "on this proposal. We are really working hard to get to a final \n",
      "rule by the end of 2023 or very early in 2024.\n",
      "    Again, I thank this Committee for your wonderful leadership \n",
      "on PFAS.\n",
      "    Senator Carper. You are welcome. It is a shared \n",
      "responsibility.\n",
      "    As you know, we all are on multiple committees. One of my \n",
      "committees is having what we call a business session right now. \n",
      "They need me there for a quorum. I have asked Senator Capito if \n",
      "she would preside in my absence, and she has graciously agreed \n",
      "to do so.\n",
      "    Keep an eye on Senator Cramer in my absence. I know that is \n",
      "a big job.\n",
      "    Thanks for your responses to my question, and Senator \n",
      "Capito, I will be back as fast as I can. Thanks so much.\n",
      "    Senator Capito [presiding]. Thank you.\n",
      "    Assistant Administrator Fox, you and I talked about this \n",
      "yesterday on the phone. This is a bit in the weeds. You came \n",
      "out several months ago, or maybe a year ago, with what was \n",
      "called a health advisory level for the PFOAs which were so low \n",
      "that, unmeasurable, systems were unable to measure as to what \n",
      "the EPA was saying would be a health advisory level.\n",
      "    You come back now with the MCL, which I am really pleased \n",
      "that we are here today to talk about that, at 4. It is \n",
      "significantly higher than what you previously said the health \n",
      "advisory level would be.\n",
      "    I asked this question, how did you base, what science was \n",
      "the basis for these health advisory levels. Yesterday I got, or \n",
      "the day before, an 1,800 page response from you and the EPA, \n",
      "which was difficult to go through because it had a lot of \n",
      "attached reports and everything with it.\n",
      "    What I am worried about is the risk communication. What \n",
      "does this mean to somebody who is actually trying to determine \n",
      "if their system is safe, and how it is going to impact the \n",
      "health and the drinking water standards? I am going to submit \n",
      "questions to you in writing, because this is going to get a \n",
      "little bit technical, and I don't want to take up all my time \n",
      "on technicalities. So if you could respond to those when I send \n",
      "them, I would very much appreciate that.\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. Yes, I would be happy to.\n",
      "    Senator Capito. Great, thank you.\n",
      "    Let me ask again on the PFOA and PFAS issue, we have set \n",
      "the drinking level, we are going to probably have requirements \n",
      "for systems to test to this level and compliance. There is \n",
      "going to be a lot of instances of what we would call passive \n",
      "receivers, somebody who, basically a water system who receives \n",
      "the water from a source and passes the water on, and maybe the \n",
      "level is a little bit higher. I am worried about the liability \n",
      "issues. I know you are not in charge of CERCLA, but have you \n",
      "all thought about this and what kinds of issues we might be \n",
      "addressing here at the Congress in terms of the passive \n",
      "liability issue for PFAS?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. You are correct, thank you for that question. On \n",
      "the CERCLA hazard designation, that is of course in our Office \n",
      "of Land and Emergency Management. But one thing that is \n",
      "particularly exciting about how we are approaching the issue of \n",
      "PFAS at the agency is we really are taking a whole of agency \n",
      "approach. The Office of Water team has engaged closely with the \n",
      "Office of Land and Emergency Management on these issues of \n",
      "passive liability. Certainly, drinking water systems, \n",
      "wastewater systems, PFAS has entered these systems, and they \n",
      "are not the responsible party.\n",
      "    So as that CERCLA hazardous designation rule continues to \n",
      "move forward, the agency is thinking about enforcement \n",
      "discretion and what is appropriate, just as we do with other \n",
      "CERCLA designations.\n",
      "    Right now, though, is such an exciting moment to be moving \n",
      "this drinking water rule forward, because we also have the \n",
      "resources in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are working \n",
      "very actively with States and local communities to make sure \n",
      "the $9 billion that you all dedicated to addressing PFAS and \n",
      "emerging contaminants is out there, that water systems are \n",
      "accessing those funds, getting these treatment technologies in \n",
      "place. I think that is going to make a huge difference as we \n",
      "move forward.\n",
      "    Senator Capito. What would you say to every State in terms \n",
      "of the retention of the flexibilities that are built into the \n",
      "systems on the revolving funds? Once those revolving funds \n",
      "leave DC and go to our States like West Virginia, is all the \n",
      "responsibility in the State then? That is what I would prefer. \n",
      "How do you see that?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. I really see it as a partnership. We have been \n",
      "very clear in our implementation memo around the Bipartisan \n",
      "Infrastructure Law that we value the flexibility that States \n",
      "have always had with the SRS. Senator Capito, if you look at \n",
      "the thousands of projects that are on these intended use plans, \n",
      "they are so diverse. They are funding drinking water, \n",
      "wastewater, stormwater, small projects, big projects, \n",
      "cybersecurity.\n",
      "    The States are very much in the driver's seat in selecting \n",
      "the projects that really meet the needs of their residents. I \n",
      "think we have preserved that.\n",
      "    It is also a partnership. It is our obligation for \n",
      "oversight and to make sure that States are utilizing various \n",
      "resources in a way that is consistent with the legislation and \n",
      "the statute. An example of that is around disadvantaged \n",
      "communities.\n",
      "    One of the things that we talked about in the SRF \n",
      "implementation memo is, we summarize that of course, States are \n",
      "the ones that determine definition of disadvantaged \n",
      "communities, both on the Clean Water SRF side as well as the \n",
      "Drinking Water SRF side. To be helpful, in that implementation \n",
      "memo we laid out criteria that tend to be good criteria that \n",
      "States are utilizing in those definitions, and then ones that \n",
      "may be more problematic. And what is so exciting is that a \n",
      "number of States sort of chose to amend their definition of \n",
      "disadvantaged communities. So we are seeing this trend line of \n",
      "those definitions really being consistent with the statute, the \n",
      "Safe Drinking Water Act and Clean Water Act.\n",
      "    Ultimately, it is a partnership, but yes, absolutely, the \n",
      "States are in the driver's seat in selecting the projects that \n",
      "best meet the needs in their borders.\n",
      "    Senator Capito. I appreciate that answer. I think part of \n",
      "your answer went to what my opening statement was saying, that \n",
      "the States need to be in the driver's seat, the States are \n",
      "going to be able to make the best determinations. I think what \n",
      "we have seen, not just at EPA but also over at Transportation, \n",
      "is the Administration is putting the foot on the pedal here in \n",
      "certain instances, and suggesting certain parameters that then \n",
      "lead to our States wondering if we don't go the way that EPA is \n",
      "saying, then are we going to have some kind of, I don't want to \n",
      "say penalty, but are we being guided by other issues that \n",
      "really, if we were doing it on our own, we wouldn't be doing it \n",
      "quite this way. I think that is a cautionary tale.\n",
      "    Senator Cramer.\n",
      "    Senator Cramer. Thank you, Senator, and thank you, \n",
      "Administrator Fox, for being here.\n",
      "    I have a lot of things to thank you for, so bear with me as \n",
      "I do a little bit of that. First of all, I don't think it can \n",
      "be overstated how important your trip to North Dakota was in \n",
      "2021. And while we had a robust discussion about the WOTUS \n",
      "rule, and I will want to ask you some things about that here in \n",
      "a little bit, probably the most fun was nerding out a little \n",
      "bit with the locals and the State water people, going through a \n",
      "water plant. It was wonderful.\n",
      "    Most importantly, you listened to people and related to \n",

      "    But after a couple of inquiries with State officials, your \n",

      "U.S. necessarily, but we don't get the opportunity often \n",
      "enough. I know that Administrator Regan will be in front of us \n",
      "for the really tough questions. We will both spare you those.\n",
      "    I wanted to bring up a couple of issues, because at that \n",

      "agency unveiled the rule, I have heard from a lot of those \n",
      "stakeholders, constituents and others, who are concerned that \n",
      "the new rule really embodies some of the same government \n",
      "overreach of the 2015 rule. I know there are some distinctions, \n",
      "and you certainly are going to clarify some of them, I am sure.\n",
      "    Anything that defers to the bureaucracy, we just get \n",
      "concerned about, because we have never really met a regulatory \n",
      "agency that didn't regulate when given the opportunity.\n",
      "    But also concerning was the rule's shift in applying the \n",
      "burden of proof. This is a very specific issue, the burden of \n",
      "proof on the landowners for proving that their land is non-\n",
      "jurisdictional, so on these jurisdictional questions. Can you \n",
      "explain why it does that? The previous rule, the Trump rule in \n",
      "its preamble states emphatically that the burden of proof is \n",
      "not on the landowner but rather on the agency. Your rule seems \n",
      "to have flipped that. Can you explain that to me a little bit?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. Yes, I am happy to. I just want to thank you for \n",
      "your hospitality. It was a wonderful visit to North Dakota. And \n",

      "    I have to say, Senator, North Dakota is doing a fabulous \n",
      "job with implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law \n",
      "resources. They have already taken all of their CAP grants for \n",
      "year one. They are moving fast on their intended use plans.\n",
      "    So it has been a great partnership. There are going to be \n",
      "some great, great projects that are funded in North Dakota. I \n",
      "can't wait to come back out for some of those groundbreakings \n",
      "as well.\n",
      "    On Waters of the United States, thank you for the \n",
      "opportunity to clarify this question that you raised. And thank \n",
      "you for hosting me in North Dakota. We just received so much \n",
      "valuable information from the wide array of stakeholders you \n",
      "brought together on Waters of the United States.\n",
      "    I am really proud of where we landed on this rule. I think \n",
      "both in my confirmation hearing, and Administrator Regan, when \n",
      "he had his confirmation hearing, we both talked about how our \n",
      "priority was to stop the ping-pong with Waters of the United \n",
      "States, and to put forward a balanced rule that provided clear \n",
      "rules of the road to farmers, to ranchers, to landowners, to \n",
      "developers. And we have done that.\n",
      "    Our rule is not the Obama Clean Water Rule. It is a much \n",
      "more narrow definition of Waters of the United States than the \n",
      "Obama Rule. It is not the Trump Navigable Waters Rule either, \n",
      "which as you know was vacated by multiple courts, and it was \n",
      "off the books as of August 2021.\n",
      "    One of the things that we really focused on in the \n",
      "development of our rule was practical implementation \n",
      "considerations. That is what I heard when I was in North \n",
      "Dakota. And on this landowner question, a couple of things that \n",
      "I would share. One is that as part of our 2023 rule, we have a \n",
      "whole landowners guide that makes it very easy for landowners \n",
      "to understand what is, if a permit might be needed or not.\n",
      "    We also have worked closely with Army Corps where they can \n",
      "provide free jurisdictional determinations to any landowner \n",
      "that asks for them and to do that quickly. So that is a key \n",
      "feature.\n",
      "    One of the things I am most proud about as far as our 2020 \n",
      "rule is we also clarified what is out. So in the rule, we \n",
      "codified eight exclusions that we heard in places like North \n",
      "Dakota are very important, for example, with prior converted \n",
      "cropland. This is something that so many farmers and ranchers \n",
      "have said, it is confusing.\n",
      "    So in the rule, we have made that a categorical exemption, \n",
      "very clear. And w We partnered very closely with USDA on that \n",
      "because we thought it was also really important that our \n",
      "definitions between the different agencies are aligned. That is \n",
      "why USDA is so supportive of this particular rule.\n",
      "    Finally, again, the focus on implementation versus fighting \n",
      "about the definition at the Federal level is really a priority \n",
      "moving forward. One thing that we did is, as we issued our \n",
      "final rule, we also issued a series of implementation \n",
      "memoranda. Some of them are between EPA and Army, where we are \n",
      "doing trainings to make sure that there is a consistent \n",
      "understanding of this definition.\n",
      "    We also have a coordination, an MOU with USDA, again on how \n",
      "do we make sure some of these programs are aligned for the \n",
      "agriculture community.\n",
      "    Senator, I believe we have delivered on what we said we \n",
      "would do. No more ping-pong, let's find the center, let's give \n",
      "people clear rules of the road as it relates to Waters of the \n",
      "United States. Then also to make sure we are protecting those \n",
      "vital water resources. I hope you see that we have struck that \n",
      "balance. We certainly have tried.\n",
      "    Senator Cramer. I appreciate that. I am sure I am the last \n",

      "    We all know the current status of our water infrastructure, \n",
      "whether it is drinking water or wastewater, it is not where it \n",
      "needs to be. We consistently get grades that are unacceptable. \n",
      "I use Baltimore City as an example. Baltimore City had the best \n",
      "drinking water system in the world 100 years ago. \n",
      "Unfortunately, some of those pipes are still underground today \n",
      "and are being used.\n",
      "    So we have challenges in Baltimore; we have challenges \n",
      "throughout our country. One of the major parts of the \n",
      "Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and increasing the resources \n",
      "going into the State Revolving Funds was to direct your efforts \n",
      "to traditionally underserved communities, communities that have \n",
      "an affordability issue with regard to doing the necessary \n",
      "infrastructure that is critical to drinking water and \n",
      "wastewater treatment.\n",
      "    Tell me how you are going about reaching those communities \n",
      "that have had challenges in the past being able to afford the \n",
      "necessary improvements to their water systems, carrying out the \n",
      "intent of Congress.\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. Thank you for that question. We are doing a couple \n",
      "of things. One is, one of the most exciting features of the \n",
      "Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is that you all provided about 49 \n",
      "percent of resources must be spent for, be put out as grants \n",
      "and principal forgiveness in disadvantaged communities. I think \n",
      "your vision in designing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has \n",
      "unlocked so much potential.\n",
      "    The challenge, Senator, is that disadvantaged communities \n",
      "often don't have the financial capacity to access the loan \n",
      "aspect of the SRFs. So by putting so much money out as grants \n",
      "and principal forgiveness, you have removed one of the critical \n",
      "barriers that these communities face.\n",
      "    But we know that just having the resources available isn't \n",
      "enough. That is why we have stood up the ambitious technical \n",
      "assistance program alongside the capital projects that we are \n",
      "funding. We have built out our environmental finance centers; \n",
      "we have 29 of them. Every region, EPA region, has an \n",
      "environmental finance center as well as national ones. They are \n",
      "basically available to any community that wants technical \n",
      "assistance in order to access the SRF funds.\n",
      "    As we design that technical assistance effort, I thought \n",
      "about when I worked at a local water utility, I was at the San \n",
      "Francisco Public Utilities Commission, and there we had access \n",
      "to all of the best engineering, design, financial planning. A \n",
      "disadvantaged community doesn't have access to those things, \n",
      "but they need that in order to get these SRF funds.\n",
      "    So we are basically making that available to any community \n",
      "that wants them. We just opened up our TA web page, so I would \n",
      "love to share that information with the Committee so that you \n",
      "can share it with your constituents.\n",
      "    We are going to be helping thousands of communities access \n",
      "these SRF dollars. Really, that is the core of the strategy, \n",
      "providing that technical assistance support, so that these \n",
      "disadvantaged communities can build their technical, financial, \n",
      "and managerial capacity.\n",
      "    Senator Cardin. I want to follow up with you as to how that \n",
      "is being implemented. We have jurisdictions like Baltimore City \n",
      "where the ratepayer support is just inadequate to deal with the \n",
      "needs that we have, because of income. Then we have communities \n",
      "like Smith Island, which are so isolated that they just don't \n",
      "have the population to be able to support the water that they \n",
      "need without greater assistance.\n",
      "    So we have different needs in our State. I am sure that is \n",
      "true throughout the country. Technical assistance would be \n",
      "critically important. But also making sure the resources get to \n",
      "those communities. Please keep us informed, and I will be \n",
      "working with you on that.\n",
      "    I want to ask you one other question about the low income \n",
      "water assistance program. We provided $3 million in the fiscal \n",
      "year 2023 omnibus for you to conduct a low income water \n",
      "assistance needs assessment. Senator Wicker and I have worked \n",
      "on the realities that water bills are beyond the capacity of \n",
      "many ratepayers today. We have a low income utility assistance \n",
      "program under LIHEAP, but we think there is a need for one \n",
      "under water. How are you implementing that needs assessment?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. Thank you for that question, and you are \n",
      "absolutely right. This issue of water affordability, even \n",
      "though the $50 billion in funding from the Federal Government \n",
      "will make a huge difference, water affordability is a growing \n",
      "challenge in communities across the country. In my former role \n",
      "as CEO for the U.S. Water Alliance, I helped create this water \n",
      "equity and affordability network.\n",
      "    As to the assessment, we are currently, we are going to \n",
      "partner with HHS in the development of that assessment, since \n",
      "they are managing the LIWAP program. We are currently designing \n",
      "the methodology for that assessment, and it is going to get \n",
      "underway very soon. And I am happy to keep your office, Senator \n",
      "Cardin, and Senator Wicker's offices up to date on how that \n",
      "assessment is going.\n",
      "    In addition to that, we are working closely to support HHS \n",
      "as they continue to administer the LIWAP program, which we are \n",
      "so grateful was developed by this Congress.\n",

      "vulnerability to our water systems.\n",
      "    We believe that in order to protect our water systems from \n",

      "resources that are out there all the time.\n",
      "    We feel that this implementation memo that I recently \n",

      "assess the operational capacities of a local water system. \n",
      "Given the critical nature of having good cybersecurity \n",

      "    Ms. Fox. No, it would not.\n",
      "    Senator Kelly. So my understanding is the rule that would \n",
      "be in effect would be something similar to the pre-2015 WOTUS \n",
      "guidance, is that correct?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. That is correct, Senator.\n",
      "    Senator Kelly. And that guidance, my understanding is that \n",
      "it relies on the same types of significant nexus test as the \n",
      "WOTUS rule that EPA and the Army Corps finalized this January, \n",
      "is that right?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. Yes, but there are key differences in how we \n",
      "approach it.\n",
      "    Senator Kelly. Can you explain those differences?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. Yes, sir. The CRA, if it were to pass, it would as \n",
      "you said put us back to the pre-2015 definition of Waters of \n",
      "the United States. That definition is broader than our 2023 \n",
      "rule; our 2023 rule is more narrow in the definition of Waters \n",
      "of the United States. It is more uncertain. So there would be \n",
      "key challenges.\n",
      "    With a CRA, you can't sort of take parts of the rule that \n",
      "work and parts that don't that people might have concerns \n",
      "about. It wipes out the entire rule and puts back in place the \n",
      "2015.\n",
      "    So we would, for example, on the question of the two test \n",
      "significant nexus, and relatively permanent, in our 2023 rule, \n",
      "significant nexus is much more narrowly defined than in 2015. \n",
      "And it would be utilized only in a very small number of waters, \n",
      "whereas it would be much more broad in the 2015 versus the \n",
      "2023.\n",
      "    Another challenge if the CRA would pass is that many of the \n",
      "exemptions and exclusions that I was talking to Senator Cramer \n",
      "about just a moment ago, those would all be voided out. And \n",
      "because the CRA says that agencies cannot ever adopt a rule \n",
      "that is similar in the future, we may never be able to ever \n",
      "bring back things like prior converted crop or exemptions for \n",
      "artificial ponds, things like that. So it would really create \n",
      "confusion, uncertainty, and void the very common sense aspects \n",
      "of the rule that we worked so hard to put in place.\n",
      "    Senator Kelly. So the things we did in the 2023 rule, that \n",
      "actually made it narrower?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. Yes.\n",
      "    Senator Kelly. If we go back to the 2015, and we do it \n",
      "through the CRA process, in the future we couldn't use those \n",
      "same items as you just addressed to get a narrower definition \n",
      "of Waters of the United States?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. That is correct. Agencies are prevented from \n",
      "issuing anything that is similar.\n",
      "    Senator Kelly. So this took us a while to sort through. It \n",
      "is not an obvious thing, how sometimes you can, through a CRA \n",
      "process, you are trying to get an outcome that might be \n",
      "narrower, and in fact you have some unintended consequences. \n",
      "And I think that is the case here. Is that your sense?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. That is absolutely the case. We would be throwing \n",
      "out a narrower definition of Waters of the United States. We \n",
      "would be throwing out all of the implementation direction that \n",
      "we provided. We would be throwing out the collaboration memos \n",
      "between USDA and EPA and Army Corps that will help with good \n",
      "implementation. We would be going back to a broader definition \n",
      "of significant nexus.\n",
      "    It would create a great deal of uncertainty in communities \n",
      "across the country. We believe it would lead to delays in \n",
      "permitting important projects, permitting infrastructure \n",
      "projects, developing happening on land. And so it is not the \n",
      "right tool.\n",
      "    We can always improve on Waters of the United States. We \n",
      "welcome that conversation with this Committee. We are also \n",
      "laser sharp focused on doing implementation work in a way that \n",
      "addresses the regional differences across the country. We would \n",
      "lose all of that if this rule gets CRAd.\n",
      "    Senator Kelly. Thank you, Administrator Fox.\n",
      "    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n",
      "    Senator Carper. Thank you, Senator Kelly, for that line of \n",
      "questioning. Some important points were made there.\n",
      "    Ms. Fox, thank you for your responses to them.\n",
      "    I mentioned this earlier; one of the things that this \n",
      "Committee looks forward to is certainty and predictability. \n",
      "That has always been the case, and I think it is the case \n",

      "Ranking Member Capito, thank you very much, and Administrator \n",
      "Fox, thanks very much for joining us.\n",
      "    Having been Governor, one of the things that I am very well \n",
      "aware of is water infrastructure and how challenging it can be, \n",
      "as Senator Cardin said, not just for big cities but also \n",
      "especially in Nebraska, small, rural communities. Obviously, \n",
      "the EPA has, on Tuesday, released its first national standard \n",
      "for six PFAS levels for drinking water. Small water systems, \n",
      "again, often don't have the technical capability for dealing \n",
      "with these and implementing these sorts of monitoring \n",
      "requirements.\n",
      "    How do you plan to assist small water systems, especially \n",
      "in rural areas, for doing the testing and compliance for being \n",
      "able to comply with this rulemaking?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. Thank you for that question. This is a huge \n",
      "priority for us in the Office of Water, how do we broadly make \n",
      "sure that smaller water systems, rural systems benefit broadly \n",
      "from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and everything that we \n",
      "are doing on this question of PFAS specifically.\n",
      "    There are a couple of things. One is that we have recently \n",
      "started our UCMR 5, which is an ongoing monitoring program. \n",
      "Historically, larger water systems do that. It is harder for \n",
      "smaller systems. We advocated for resources so that smaller \n",
      "systems could do that. Because of the generosity of Congress, \n",
      "we have resources now to work with smaller systems on that.\n",
      "    In the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, there is a new $5 \n",
      "billion grant program that is dedicated to small systems and \n",
      "disadvantaged communities to basically look at issues of PFAS \n",
      "and other emerging contaminants. So that is going to be \n",
      "resources that are dedicated to the very communities that you \n",
      "are asking about, Senator. Those resources can help other grant \n",
      "programs, so you don't have to pay anything back. They can use \n",
      "that for testing, for remediation, implementing treatment \n",
      "technologies. So that is going to make a huge difference.\n",
      "    What we have learned in our work across rural America is \n",
      "that just getting resources, making resources available isn't \n",
      "enough. You have got to support smaller systems, rural systems, \n",
      "in building their technical, financial, and managerial capacity \n",
      "to be able to both get that grant or get that loan, and then be \n",
      "able to implement it well.\n",
      "    That is why we are spending so much time building out the \n",
      "technical assistance infrastructure. We have 29 environmental \n",
      "finance centers. We have actually increased our contracts with \n",
      "National Rural Water and with RCAP, the Rural Community \n",
      "Assistance Program, because they have direct touch points in \n",
      "rural America. So they are going to be doing even more \n",
      "technical assistance in these areas.\n",
      "    So that is some of what we have underway. And we think it \n",
      "is really going to change the odds in rural America.\n",
      "    Senator Ricketts. So how would a smaller community be able \n",
      "to access some of those resources you are talking about?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. We have just put up a technical assistance web \n",
      "page on our website. I would be happy to share that information \n",
      "with your office.\n",
      "    Senator Ricketts. Please do.\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. Then also, we are working very closely with the \n",
      "States. Many States also have technical assistance programs. So \n",
      "we are trying to coordinate. Your environmental secretary, your \n",
      "SRF State manager, they are going to know the communities that \n",
      "are out of compliance; they are going to know the communities \n",
      "that are keeping them up at night as it relates to clean, safe \n",
      "water.\n",
      "    So we are asking them. We are building this list of \n",
      "communities. And then we are not waiting for people, for a \n",
      "community to come to us. When we hear from a State or a local \n",
      "water system that something is of concern, we are having our \n",
      "technical assistance providers actively reach out to them. So \n",
      "we have to go to the community, not just wait for them to ask \n",
      "for help.\n",
      "    Senator Ricketts. Great, thank you. I am running out of \n",
      "time here, so I am just going to talk about another thing we \n",
      "were talking about with some of the investments for these \n",
      "communities. The intent of these funds was to help communities \n",
      "that need the most to be able to get the resources. My \n",
      "understanding, though, is that some communities feel like there \n",
      "have been other priorities put in there with regard to climate \n",
      "rather than safe drinking water.\n",
      "    Is that something you feel is being pushed in the \n",
      "legislation? That was not Congress's intent. Or do you feel \n",
      "people are just taking this the wrong way? What is your \n",
      "response when you hear some of those criticisms?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. I do think it is a misunderstanding, Senator. We \n",
      "have been very clear in our implementation memo and in all of \n",
      "our discussions that the States are in the driver's seat in \n",
      "making decisions around the SRF program. Because they know what \n",
      "communities need those resources the most.\n",
      "    So we have been clear on that. We certainly encourage \n",
      "climate considerations. But it is not a requirement. Certainly \n",
      "in places like Oklahoma, drought is a top concern. So, \n",
      "certainly projects that are going to help water supply \n",
      "diversification and conservation ground water re-use and \n",
      "recharge, these are things that are going to really matter in \n",
      "communities.\n",
      "    But no, the States are in the driver's seat as far as \n",
      "selecting projects.\n",
      "    Senator Ricketts. Great. Thank you very much.\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. Thank you.\n",
      "    Senator Carper. Senator Ricketts, thanks for joining us.\n",
      "    Senator Sullivan, good morning. Welcome.\n",
      "    Senator Sullivan. Ms. Fox, I want to start with a chart \n",
      "here that I have trotted out a lot in this committee room. This \n",
      "is a chart of life expectancy in America and in Alaska in \n",
      "particular for the last 25 years, from 1980 to 2014. Do you see \n",
      "where the blue and dark blue is? That is life expectancy going \n",
      "up a lot. Actually yellow, orange, red, actually life \n",
      "expectancy has decreased, that is really sad in America. Mostly \n",
      "that has been due to the opioid epidemic that has killed so \n",
      "many Americans.\n",
      "    But my State, particularly in the rural regions, the North \n",
      "Slope, interior, Aleutian Island chain, has had the largest \n",
      "life expectancy increases of any place in the country in the \n",
      "last 25 years, up to 13 years in many of our rural areas. So \n",
      "that is a great indicator of policy success.\n",
      "    Why do you think that happened? That is a hard question. \n",
      "But 1980 to 2014, what else happened in Alaska during that \n",
      "time? I will just answer. It is not an easy question.\n",
      "    So we had a very big boom in resource development, oil and \n",
      "gas, mining. So when I get upset about these issues, when \n",
      "Federal agencies try to shut down resource development in my \n",
      "State, it is literally a matter of life and death. The \n",
      "communities in rural Alaska that have benefited from that, they \n",
      "are living longer. And I don't know if there is any policy \n",
      "indicator of success more important than are the people you \n",
      "representing living longer.\n",
      "    Would you agree with me?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. Yes.\n",
      "    Senator Sullivan. Anything more important than that?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. No.\n",
      "    Senator Sullivan. No, I don't think so, either.\n",
      "    So one of the things that is frustrating, we just went \n",
      "through this Willow process, the vast, vast majority of the \n",
      "Alaska Native people were supportive. The national media hated \n",
      "to write that story. They kept canceling the voices of the \n",
      "indigenous people of Alaska. But we finally got it out there.\n",
      "    And one of the big reasons is because of this. They know it \n",
      "is jobs, pride, things that most communities take for granted \n",
      "like running water, flush toilets. You get infrastructure, you \n",
      "get jobs, you get revenues, you can do those things that, in \n",
      "parts of my State, people haven't had access to for a long \n",
      "time, maybe ever.\n",
      "    So let me talk about a related area. But it is all in this \n",
      "area, too, it is mining. Unfortunately, the Administration on a \n",
      "number of mining projects, the Ambler mining district in \n",
      "particular, we did a 7 year EIS, $10 million. The same day the \n",
      "President held a critical mineral summit at the White House on \n",
      "the importance of cutting our dependence on foreign critical \n",
      "minerals like from China. They reversed that EIS in Alaska.\n",
      "    Now, that was the Department of Interior, Secretary Haaland \n",
      "seems hell bent on reversing everything, despite that chart. \n",
      "Kind of remarkable that she would be doing that. But the EPA \n",
      "recently finalized this 404(c) action on Pebble, the preemptive \n",
      "veto action, but you said, ``It is also important to note that \n",
      "the EPA's action does not apply to current or future resource \n",
      "development projects in Alaska.'' Similarly, Administrator \n",
      "Regan said, ``By no means is this decision meant to send any \n",
      "signals beyond this specific project.''\n",
      "    Can you begin by recommitting to me that EPA won't use \n",
      "404(c) as a precedent to stop future Alaska projects, or \n",
      "importantly, anything that has already previously been \n",
      "permitted in Alaska? Keeping this in mind. Because when you do \n",
      "that, when Deb Haaland recently reversed the Ambler decision, \n",
      "she actually yesterday reversed the King Cove Road decision, \n",
      "there is no Native project that people in Alaska care about \n",
      "that she doesn't reverse, the Native people, by the way, again, \n",
      "stunning to me. But can you recommit to what you and the \n",
      "Administrator already said with regard to mining projects in my \n",
      "State?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. Yes, and Senator Sullivan, it is good to see you \n",
      "again. I was just thinking, seeing your map, the last time we \n",
      "were together was at the Bethel Airport, this past summer when \n",
      "we were both visiting an Alaska Native village that was working \n",
      "on a water infrastructure project. So it is good to see you \n",
      "again.\n",
      "    And yes, to be clear, EPA has sparingly used our 404(c) \n",
      "authority, only three times in the last 30 years, three times. \n",
      "That is it. And yes, I commit, as does Administrator Regan, \n",
      "that it will be sparingly used. We were very clear that that \n",
      "404(c) action was about a particular mine and a particular \n",
      "geography, the geography of Bristol Bay, a beautiful and unique \n",
      "ecosystem.\n",
      "    Senator Sullivan. OK, thank you, I don't want to interrupt. \n",
      "I just have one final question. I spoke at the annual \n",
      "conference of the Tanana Chiefs Conference yesterday in \n",
      "interior Alaska. I talked about water and sewer and the needs \n",
      "to get some of the communities, we have 30 communities in \n",
      "Alaska that don't have flush toilets and running water.\n",
      "    By the way, these are some of the most patriotic \n",
      "communities in America, because Alaska Natives serve at higher \n",
      "rates in the military than any other ethnic group in the \n",
      "country.\n",
      "    So can you recommit to me, given the resources in the \n",
      "Infrastructure Bill, I told them that you are going to be \n",
      "working with us on getting rid of what we call honey buckets, \n",
      "which is a euphemism for people having to go to the bathroom \n",
      "and then take their own waste out and throw it in a lagoon. \n",
      "Pretty disgusting. American citizens still do that in my State.\n",
      "    Can you recommit to me to help us get rid of the honey \n",
      "bucket once and for all?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. Absolutely. Seeing first hand people living with \n",
      "honey buckets with washeterias when I visited Alaska last \n",
      "August, I am absolutely committed to this. And I think we have \n",
      "the ability to make tremendous progress because of the \n",
      "Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the incredible leadership \n",
      "that President Biden and this Congress have made in investing \n",
      "$50 billion. So you have my absolute commitment on that.\n",
      "    Senator Sullivan. Great. Thank you.\n",
      "    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n",
      "    Senator Carper. Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "    In the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Ms. Fox, Congress \n",
      "committed to ensuring that disadvantaged communities benefit \n",
      "from Federal drinking water and wastewater infrastructure \n",
      "investments. The Biden administration has made the same pledge \n",
      "through its Justice 40 initiative.\n",
      "    State policies such as project ranking systems that have \n",
      "additional eligibility criteria can create barriers to \n",
      "disadvantaged and underserved communities' ability to access \n",
      "funds. Here is my question: Is EPA tracking these State level \n",
      "barriers, and what is the agency's plan to help communities \n",
      "overcome these barriers so that they can access Federal \n",
      "investment in water infrastructure?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. Thank you for that question. Yes, Senator, we are \n",
      "tracking those barriers and working actively with individual \n",
      "States as well as with CIFA, the Council of Infrastructure \n",
      "Financing Authorities, to collaboratively develop solutions to \n",
      "those barriers.\n",
      "    The States and EPA, we share a commitment to making sure \n",
      "that we make these resources available to as many communities \n",
      "as possible. And things like a project ranking system, it is a \n",
      "barrier in some States. There are other barriers that exist as \n",
      "well. Some States, for example, have only an annual application \n",
      "process, while other States allow for multiple rounds of \n",
      "submission of SRFs. That is another thing.\n",
      "    I think there are challenges around local communities \n",
      "knowing when to apply and having full transparency into that \n",
      "process. So there are a range of barriers, as there are with \n",
      "many funding and financing programs across the Federal \n",
      "Government. So we are very closely partnering with the States \n",
      "to work through those together.\n",
      "    One thing I can also say is there is an incredible amount \n",
      "of peer exchange and learning that is happening right now \n",
      "across States. There are trainings and opportunities for the \n",
      "States to come together to learn from one another. And we want \n",
      "to support and encourage that as much as possible, as well.\n",
      "    Senator Carper. All right, thank you.\n",
      "    One of the Biden administration's priorities has been to \n",
      "replace lead service lines. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law \n",
      "included $15 billion in funding for full lead service line \n",
      "replacements, a lot of money. In the years leading up to the \n",
      "passage of that law, we heard from several States, including my \n",
      "own State of Delaware, that the prevalence of lead service \n",
      "lines was not a significant problem. However, as some of those \n",
      "States started doing lead inventories, it became clear that the \n",
      "presence of lead pipes and the health impacts they cause is \n",
      "more pervasive than a lot of folks expected.\n",
      "    Given this initial skepticism, have the States been able to \n",
      "use funding for lead service line replacements?\n",
      "    Ms. Fox. One of the most exciting aspects of this job and \n",
      "serving in this capacity is to help deliver on President \n",
      "Biden's commitment to get the lead out once and for all. It is \n",
      "just so remarkable, the President's leadership on this issue. \n",
      "And at the EPA, we are using every tool in our tool box to \n",
      "deliver on that.\n",
      "    As it relates to your question, Senator, the reaction is \n",
      "mixed. There are some States that feel that their allocation of \n",
      "lead service line money is insufficient for the need. Others \n",
      "think that the allocation is too much, given how much the need \n",
      "is there. So we are in constant conversation with the States to \n",
      "understand that.\n",
      "    We do have what is called a reallotment process that we can \n",
      "utilize, so that after 2 years, if a State doesn't use their \n",
      "lead service line money, we can reallocate it to a State that \n",
      "could use it. So right now, we are in the process of working \n",
      "with the States to make sure that they know they can use this \n",

      "instead of having four engines working, they had two. They had \n",
      "a full bag of fuel and fully loaded. And they tried to come \n",
      "around and land on the runway, they lost their altitude, they \n",

      "    What is not as apparent is how the city can pay for it \n",
      "without raising our water and sewer rates to unsustainable \n",
      "levels. Fortunately, passage of the DWWIA came at an opportune \n",
      "time, because our city was working to implement this plan. And \n",
      "last month, President Biden announced that Philadelphia will \n",
      "receive $500 million in financing through several different \n",
      "programs authorized and funded by----\n",
      "    Senator Carper. Could you say that again? How much was \n",
      "that?\n",
      "    Mr. Hayman. Five hundred million, a significant amount.\n",
      "    This includes $160 million through Pennsylvania's share of \n",
      "the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds to upgrade treatment \n",
      "facilities and replace more than 19 miles of water mains and \n",
      "any lead service lines discovered during this work.\n",
      "    Additionally, in January, Philadelphia closed on a $19.8 \n",
      "million loan from EPA's WIFIA program. This will support the \n",
      "replacement of 15 miles of water mains and approximately 160 \n",
      "lead service lines throughout the city at lower financing costs \n",
      "than we otherwise would have faced. This loan represents just \n",

      "promised to Philadelphia by EPA. These future investments will \n",
      "be paid for by subsequent rounds of WIFIA loans.\n",
      "    So this is why it is so essential that Congress reauthorize \n",
      "WIFIA as part of the DWWIA and set a course for the program \n",
      "stability in years to come. While WIFIA has become consistently \n",
      "funded by Congress, DWWIA extended multiple other water and \n",
      "wastewater infrastructure funding programs, many of which are \n",
      "still awaiting meaningful investments and appropriations by \n",
      "Congress, implementation by EPA.\n",
      "    One such program is EPA's Midsize and Large Drinking Water \n",
      "System Infrastructure Resilience and Sustainability Program, \n",
      "which will help drinking water systems prepare to withstand the \n",
      "effects of natural disasters and cybersecurity threats. AMWA \n",
      "championed creation of this program, alongside Senator Ben \n",
      "Cardin, and we are pleased to see it received an initial $5 \n",
      "million appropriation in the final fiscal year 2023 spending \n",

      "    However, the national need is much greater than $5 million. \n",

      "even more effective. First, we greatly appreciate the law \n",
      "authorized a new low income water wastewater system pilot \n",
      "program at EPA. Water affordability is a national need, and it \n",
      "should be part of the Federal safety net. AMWA urges EPA to \n",
      "quickly complete its required National Water Affordability \n",
      "Needs Assessment, so that the pilot program can be funded and \n",
      "put to work.\n",
      "    We would also appreciate more clarity and consistency in \n",
      "relation to which communities are eligible to receive \n",
      "additional subsidized SRF funding provided by the bill. EPA has \n",
      "specified that this is available to disadvantaged communities.\n",
      "    But due to several factors, Philadelphia Water cannot \n",
      "assess grants of principal forgiveness through the PENNVEST \n",
      "State Revolving Fund, most prominently due to the affordability \n",
      "methodology used. This means that the loans currently being \n",
      "provided through the Bill funding will have to be repaid \n",
      "through higher water bills in Philadelphia and other \n",

      "    One obstacle to getting these funding plans approved and \n",
      "funds distributed quickly is that many of the most immediate \n",
      "costs utilities face including monitoring, assessing, and \n",
      "implementing pre-treatment programs. However, these important \n",

      "However, congressional clarity or a distinct pot of funding \n",
      "focused on helping communities assess PFAS sources entering \n",
      "their wastewater streams may be needed.\n",
      "    Another issue we have is how to support customers and \n",
      "ratepayers in need of low income water assistance and address \n",
      "affordability challenges. BIL directed EPA to conduct a \n",
      "national low income water needs assessment, which has since \n",

      "Congress and the public understand the full scope of national \n",

      "water out of small systems. We know that is a huge issue for \n",
      "us. We have some lead, we know that was discovered in the north \n",

      "destruction of PFAS, what are we going to do with it when we \n",

      "some of the things, if you could, from your perspective.\n",
      "    Ms. Emery. I think the primary thing is affordability and \n",

      "    Senator Capito. For the systems or the individuals, or \n",
      "both?\n",
      "    Ms. Emery. Yes, all of the above.\n",

      "    Ms. Emery. In addition to just what we were talking about, \n",

      "services out to other communities, other areas. Now we are \n",
      "trying to assess the PFAS situation in West Virginia, where is \n",
      "it, where is the contamination coming from. And we are adding \n",
      "lead service lines on top of all of that.\n",
      "    So it is a lot for all of these communities to take on. And \n",
      "we are working with them on these one by one. That is why the \n",
      "flexibility of the SRFs I think has to be maintained. Our \n",
      "communities, some of the more rural, disadvantaged, trying to \n",
      "gather enough grant funding and debt forgiveness to support \n",
      "just the projects that they have, because they can't sustain \n",
      "debt service. They are struggling just to pay their operation \n",
      "and maintenance.\n",
      "    Senator Capito. Right. The customers can't afford another \n",
      "rate hike. I know that is always part of the consideration.\n",
      "    Ms. Emery. An example for that is the community of Iaeger \n",
      "in McDowell County. It is one of our most economically \n",
      "distressed counties. We are finally getting a sewer system into \n",
      "Iaeger. It is a combination of a lot of grant funding sources.\n",
      "    But I was looking at the combined water and wastewater rate \n",
      "for those citizens. It will be over $100 a month. It will be \n",
      "over 3 percent of the median household income, just for water \n",
      "and wastewater. That is without adding on other considerations \n",
      "going forward.\n",

      "    Mr. Hayman and Mr. Sigmund, in the last Congress I worked \n",
      "with Senator Risch to introduce the Water Infrastructure \n",
      "Modernization Act, which would provide dedicated EPA funding \n",
      "for smart water and wastewater technologies, like pipeline leak \n",
      "detection systems and sensors and smart water meters. We are \n",
      "hoping to reintroduce this legislation again and see progress \n",
      "made on the legislation during this Congress.\n",
      "    For both of you, can you speak to how your systems use \n",
      "smart water technologies to reduce water loss and improve \n",
      "system efficiencies, and how would additional Federal resources \n",
      "such as through the Water Infrastructure Modernization Act help \n",
      "water and wastewater systems further deploy these technologies?\n",
      "    Mr. Hayman. I will gladly take that question, Senator. It \n",
      "is important that as a water utility that we keep evolving. And \n",
      "one of the main things we have to do is use technology to our \n",
      "advantage, and do it in a way that is economically feasible. \n",
      "Affordability is a big issue. But when we are able to use \n",
      "technology in the big picture to develop a system that is \n",
      "responsible to our customers, we are doing what is the right \n",
      "thing to do.\n",
      "    As far as smart technology, we have AMI, the Automated \n",
      "Meter Infrastructure program, where we are able to get real \n",
      "time information about water usage. So you go to the app, go to \n",
      "the website, and look and see, what is my bill. What happens in \n",
      "that situation, instead of having a running pipe, let's say a \n",
      "broken toilet that you are not aware of in the basement, and \n",
      "your bill is going up, you will be able to go to the site, and \n",
      "you will see what your bill is. That information truly is power \n",
      "and allows you to be more economically sensible in how you are \n",
      "handling your household economics.\n",
      "    The bottom line, too, is we also have systems that allow us \n",
      "to hear leaks in pipes. We had a situation where there was a \n",
      "leakage, we couldn't find it. We used the technology, we are \n",
      "working still to pinpoint it, but we are a lot closer than we \n",
      "were before.\n",
      "    So the use of technology is important. And the funding is \n",
      "imperative, because all the things we want to do cost. We are \n",
      "dealing with a situation where rates are getting higher and \n",
      "higher, coming to a level of not being sustainable for many in \n",
      "our communities.\n",
      "    So any moneys we are able to receive to allow us to assist \n",
      "the customer and to allow us to keep our rates low or not to \n",
      "increase at all, is beneficial to the entire community.\n",
      "    Senator Kelly. Do you have any examples of percentage wise, \n",
      "or gallons or acre feet of water that a specific investment has \n",
      "resulted in? Any anecdotal example.\n",
      "    Mr. Hayman. I would have to go back and supplement the \n",
      "record after the hearing on that. But I must say that the AMI \n",
      "process, of being able to have real time information, is truly \n",
      "important, and it is revolutionary in Philadelphia. Because \n",
      "what is happening is that people can monitor the water usage, \n",
      "they can monitor if there is a leak in a pipe. It is a $100 \n",
      "million project. But it is going to be greatly beneficial for \n",
      "decades to come.\n",
      "    Senator Kelly. Mr. Sigmund.\n",
      "    Mr. Sigmund. Coming from a clean water utility, water loss \n",
      "is not a concern for us. But in the implementation of smart \n",
      "technology, in our interceptor systems, we do use some of the \n",
      "smart meter covers to be able to identify, during periods of \n",
      "wet weather events, high flows that we might either reroute \n",
      "flows if that is possible. Because oftentimes rainfall is not \n",
      "uniform across the service area. Or to be able to deploy forces \n",
      "to potentially mitigate some of the problems with high flows.\n",
      "    Within our treatment facilities, we are a huge energy user. \n",
      "So we have used smart technologies to be able to analyze how we \n",
      "use energy and possibly tie it to some of our aeration \n",
      "equipment to maybe slow down some of the aeration equipment \n",
      "when it is not needed to run at quite the full capacity.\n",
      "    The ability to mine this tremendous amount of information \n",
      "that we collect, we collect tons of information, and our staff \n",
      "can only manage so much, we have gone to technologies to be \n",
      "able to predict where we would go, which helps our operators \n",
      "make better decisions.\n",
      "    So the smart technology in wastewater and utilities is \n",
      "being used, and it is being beneficial, and I mentioned with \n",
      "staffing, as we are struggling to continue to find treatment \n",
      "operators, maintenance and electrician technicians, that smart \n",
      "technology is allowing us to stretch those forces a little \n",
      "farther.\n",

      "helpful as we go through this rulemaking to be able to make \n",
      "sure communities can apply?\n",
      "    Do you want to start, Mr. Hayman?\n",
      "    Mr. Hayman. With PFAS, I think a couple of things. One, it \n",
      "is important that we understand what are we looking at, that we \n",
      "understand what the numbers are. We are going to be receiving a \n",
      "lot of new data on PFAS, so it is important that we work \n",
      "closely with the scientists and engineers to see, what does \n",
      "that really mean.\n",
      "    The other part of it is that anything that we do with PFAS, \n",
      "it is going to be an additional cost. It is going to be an \n",
      "additional burden to the ratepayer. So it is imperative that we \n",
      "receive some funding to assist us in making sure that we are \n",
      "not putting upon the ratepayer a burden that they can't carry, \n",
      "or additional bills that they would have to cover.\n",
      "    Basically, though, I would say that we are going to have to \n",
      "work with our engineers to evaluate it, to make sure we have \n",
      "the machinery to do it. I have to say this: I am very proud of \n",
      "Philadelphia. We are often on the cutting edge, and on this \n",
      "issue, we are on the cutting edge of evaluating PFAS. We have \n",
      "been doing that voluntarily for over a year. We have been \n",
      "putting the information that we find on our website.\n",
      "    Also, we have been transparent. I think too that is going \n",
      "to be a major part of being successful as a water utility in \n",
      "this country, that we cannot go back to how we operated in the \n",
      "1950s, 1960s. There is a need to be transparent. We have done \n",
      "that as far as releasing information and keeping the public \n",
      "informed.\n",
      "    We have to make sure we have the machinery we need and \n",

      "couple years of doing an assessment of all our drinking water \n",

      "located, at least starting with the drinking water utilities. \n",
      "We are doing further analysis, further testing, finished water, \n",

      "    That being said, we are trying to be very strategic on how \n",
      "we address this, where it is located, where it is coming from. \n",
      "So one of the suggestions we would have is allowing more \n",
      "monitoring to be used out of this emerging contaminants \n",
      "funding. It does say that we can use monitoring, but it has to \n",
      "be specifically tied to an upcoming project. But our POTWs are \n",
      "worried about the expense of monitoring on themselves.\n",
      "    So the flexibility to use this funding to do just \n",
      "monitoring and studies, just to figure out the realm of the \n",

      "Republicans.\n",
      "    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided I think more \n",
      "than $11 billion to the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan \n",
      "Fund over 5 years. The law dictates that some 49 percent of \n",
      "each State's annual funding allocation ``shall be used by the \n",
      "State to provide grants, forgiveness of principal, or a \n",
      "combination of both.''\n",
      "    Whether a project is eligible for a grant from the SRF as \n",
      "opposed to a loan is determined by each State's own rules on \n",
      "this subject. Some of the State determined affordability \n",
      "criteria, however, prevent large cities like Philadelphia from \n",
      "being able to receive grants for loan forgiveness for water \n",

      "could support if the affordability criteria was changed?\n",
      "    Mr. Hayman. Thank you, Senator. Thank you very much for the \n",
      "question.\n",
      "    The bottom line is yes, we are having difficulty in \n",
      "receiving grants from the PENNVEST State Revolving Fund, \n",
      "primarily because of the way that they determine economic \n",
      "feasibility or accountability. Basically what they are saying \n",
      "is that our rates are too low. And what is happening is they \n",
      "are looking at what people are able to pay across the entire \n",
      "board. While there might be one area that is richer than \n",
      "another, that skews the numbers. And as a result, despite the \n",
      "size of Philadelphia, despite being one of the largest, poorest \n",
      "cities in the country, we are in a situation where we are not \n",
      "able to obtain the grants.\n",
      "    As a result, we receive loans, and those loans then put a \n",
      "burden on the customer, because those loans have to be repaid.\n",
      "    Now, let me also answer your second part, if I may. You \n",
      "stated that there is, what projects could we do. There are a \n",
      "plethora of projects that we have. As I said earlier, our \n",
      "engineers are smart, and we have tons of projects that we could \n",
      "work on. One of them is our Water Revitalization Program. It is \n",
      "going to turn around and have 400 projects that allow us to \n",
      "rebuild our water plants, our transmission mains, and make sure \n",
      "we have the tunnels that we need to transport redundancy and \n",
      "transport the water across from different water utility parts.\n",
      "    So in the end, there are pipes that can be replaced or \n",
      "there are plants that can be repaired, there are a number of \n",
      "projects we would use the moneys for. And again, grants are \n",
      "better than the loans, because they do not place an economic \n",
      "responsibility on the customer down the road. They don't have \n",
      "to be repaid.\n",
      "    Senator Carper. Good. Thank you.\n",
      "    My second question, Mr. Sigmund, according to a report by \n",

      "Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, it is estimated \n",
      "that drinking water and wastewater utilities will need an \n",

      "    While I was glad to see those programs receiving funding \n",

      "problems caused by climate change?\n",
      "    Mr. Sigmund. I would answer yes, it is very important for \n",
      "Congress to fully fund these programs. What NACWA has provided \n",
      "to you is not an exaggeration. It is where we see the state of \n",
      "our infrastructure; we are a very heavy capital infrastructure. \n",
      "We make it last a long time, but it doesn't last forever and \n",
      "needs to be replaced.\n",
      "    The resiliency from climate change, in my utility we have \n",
      "seen our system be stressed three times in the last 5 years at \n",
      "its maximum capacity. We are able to deliver service because we \n",
      "had all of our equipment able to be in service, which is not \n",
      "always the case, because of maintenance.\n",
      "    So we are seeing in our State of Wisconsin and our area not \n",
      "necessarily more rainfall throughout the year, maybe a little \n",

      "organization, information regarding cybersecurity or weather \n",
      "issues, climate change issues, all come to one depository. So \n",
      "it is gathered, it is analyzed, it is distributed. It ends up \n",

      "    Mr. Hayman, do you agree that Congress should pass the \n",
      "legislation so that we should increase the information sharing, \n",
      "smaller utilities gain access to this information as well?\n",
      "    Mr. Hayman. Absolutely. Absolutely, because the more \n",
      "organizations are able to have access to it, the better we are \n",
      "able to protect the health and safety of everyone.\n",
      "    Senator Markey. So these small water agencies, they deserve \n",
      "that same kind of information?\n",
      "    Mr. Hayman. Absolutely. Because often, they are left out, \n",
      "and they need it the most. So anything that opens up that door \n",
      "of opportunity, we should do.\n",
      "    Senator Markey. Exactly. And what we just saw in East \n",

      "    Mr. Hayman. Absolutely.\n",
      "    Senator Markey. So we don't need small water systems left \n",

Thomas R. Carper \\n(Chairman of the Committee) presiding.\\n    Present: Senators Carper, Capito, Cardin, Markey, Kelly, \\nCramer, Lummis, Sullivan, and Ricketts.\\n\\n          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. THOMAS R. CARPER, \\n            U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF DELAWARE\\n\\n    Senator Carper. Good morning. Let me call this hearing to \\norder.\\n    We are here today to examine the implementation of the \\nDrinking Water and Wastewater portions of the Bipartisan \\nInfrastructure Law. As you will recall, this historic \\nbipartisan law is helping to deliver clean drinking water to \\nmillions of households and schools across our country.\\n    Before we do that, let me start by saying how grateful I am \\nto both panels of witnesses that are joining us today, \\nincluding representatives of drinking water, clean water, as \\nwell as small and large utilities. We are particularly \\nappreciative that Assistant Administrator Radhika Fox, who \\nleads EPA's Office of Water, has joined us.\\n    Welcome.\\n    To all of our guests; we have a lot of folks, Senator \\nCapito, I don't think we have had that many photos before a \\nhearing in a long time. We want to remember this day.\\n    Yesterday, the Biden administration took a major step in \\naddressing the presence of toxic forever chemicals known as \\nPFAS in our drinking water. This announcement was some 20 years \\nin the making. It is an issue that is very important to, as it \\nturns out, to West Virginia and to Delaware, and frankly, to \\nall the other 48 States across the country. I want to commend \\nthe President; I want to commend Administrator Regan, Assistant \\nAdministrator Fox, and all of EPA for proposing a thoughtful, \\nscience based, national drinking water standard for PFAS.\\n    This critical step to protecting our drinking water comes \\non top of the President calling for significant investments to \\nprotect our public health and environment in his proposed 2024 \\nbudget released last week. In his budget, the President \\nrequested more than $12 billion for EPA, $1.9 billion, a 19 \\npercent increase from the 2023 enacted level. More than $4 \\nbillion of that proposal is reserved for water infrastructure. \\nThat includes an additional $219 million for grants to reduce \\nthe amount of lead in drinking water, to test for and remove \\nlead in schools, and to replace lead pipes.\\n    This budget builds on the Committee's work in the \\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law to invest in our nation's water \\ninfrastructure, which brings us to the topic of today's \\nhearing: Oversight of the implementation of the drinking water \\nand wastewater portions of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\\n    As we have discussed, Democrats and Republicans on this \\npanel, it is not just enough to enact landmark legislation like \\nthis, but it is important that it be appropriately implemented \\nand that we exercise our responsibilities with respect to \\noversight. That is part of what we are doing here today.\\n    Our work on this Committee to improve our water \\ninfrastructure is personal to me. We have some folks here from \\nWest Virginia who have joined us; welcome.\\n    If you're from West Virginia, raise your hand. If you would \\nlike to be from West Virginia, raise your hand.\\n    [Laughter.]\\n    Senator Carper. Almost everybody, for the record.\\n    Our work in this Committee is to improve our water and \\ninfrastructure. As I said, it is personal to me, rooted in my \\nfaith and my family's history in Raleigh County, West Virginia. \\nSome of you may recall that Matthew 25 calls on all of us to \\nactually care for those that are in need, the least of these, \\nto give those that are thirsty something to drink. For me, this \\nincludes that ensuring that Americans have access to clean, \\nsafe, and reliable water services.\\n    Some of you may recall, I was born in Beckley, in a coal \\nmining town in the southern part of the State. For 2 of those 6 \\nyears that we actually lived there, my first 6 years of my \\nlife, we lived alongside a stream. Our Ranking Member has heard \\nof Beaver; she's been to Beaver right outside of Beckley many \\ntimes. There is a creek that goes through there called Beaver \\nCreek. My sister and I lived alongside Beaver Creek.\\n    We would play along the banks of that creek. We would try \\nto catch small fish, sometimes frogs, and we were never allowed \\nto eat any of them. Nor were we allowed to drink the water from \\nBeaver Creek. That is because many of the nearby septic tanks \\nwere not well maintained, and as a result raw sewage and other \\npollution could seep into that creek. At the time, our \\nsituation was not too different from that of many other small \\ncommunities in West Virginia and across the country.\\n    In the years that followed, our Government has responded to \\nthis water crisis by creating grant and later loan programs \\nthat made it easier for communities across our country to build \\nand upgrade drinking water and wastewater treatment systems. \\nOver time, these programs languished and were in dire need of \\nupdating.\\n    That is why I, along with our Ranking Member, Senator \\nCapito, Senator Cardin, Senator Lummis, Senator Duckworth, \\nSenator Cramer, and many other members of this Committee and \\noff this Committee joined forces to address this need. We \\nworked in an overwhelmingly bipartisan way to draft the \\nDrinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act. You will \\nrecall that our legislation included historic investments in \\nEPA's State Revolving Funds. Those funds were the primary \\nvehicle for State and local governments to finance water \\ninfrastructure projects throughout America.\\n    We advanced our legislation out of Committee unanimously \\nand later passed it out of the full Senate by a vote of 89 to \\n2. If the American people are looking for bipartisanship, they \\nneed look no further than this Committee and its work on \\ninfrastructure. This water bill, combined with our Committee's \\nhistoric highway legislation, roads, highways, bridges, served \\nas the foundation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which \\nPresident Biden signed into law in November 2021, a happy day \\nfor all of us.\\n    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invested an unprecedented \\n$55 billion, $55 billion, that's billion with a B, to improve \\ndrinking water and wastewater systems in communities across our \\ncountry, and it was paid for, fully offset. This remains the \\nsingle largest water infrastructure investment in our nation's \\nhistory. Let me repeat that: This remains the single largest \\nwater infrastructure investment in our nation's history. Now, \\nEPA has the responsibility of putting these dollars, these \\ninvestments, to work for all of the American people.\\n    Today's hearing is an opportunity to gain a deeper \\nunderstanding of how this process is going. This hearing will \\nallow us to explore future opportunities to improve the way we \\ninvest in our drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. \\nThat includes investigating how the Bipartisan Infrastructure \\nLaw programs are benefiting communities with the greatest need \\nand what additional authorities or changes might be needed to \\nmake the program function better.\\n    I like to say, everything I do, I know I can do better. And \\nas proud as we are of this legislation, we know that we can \\nstill improve on it further. For example, is there more that \\ncould be done to adapt these programs to changes in our climate \\nand our population and the age of our infrastructure?\\n    As I said earlier, we look forward to hearing from our \\ndistinguished panels of witnesses today. Before we do, let me \\nturn to Senator Capito for her opening remarks.\\n    Senator Capito, you are recognized.\\n\\n        OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO, \\n          U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA\\n\\n    Senator Capito. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank all of \\nyou for being here today.\\n    I would like to thank Assistant Administrator Fox for not \\njust being here today but for the lines of communication that \\nyou have kept open, as you promised in your hearing when you \\ncame before this Committee. You have stayed true to your word. \\nI certainly appreciate that, from my perspective.\\n    I would also like to thank you for finally, after many \\nyears of me banging the gavel and the gong and also with the \\nChair to set that safe drinking level for PFAS. That is going \\nto have many impacts across the country. Certainly, safe, \\nclean, and healthy water is at the top of the list for all of \\nus.\\n    This Committee values your perspectives on the challenges, \\nand other witnesses' as well, facing this nation's water \\ninfrastructure, as well as your insights on implementing the \\neffective solutions to these challenges. Today's hearing is \\nfocused on a topic that is of critical importance, and the \\nChairman has covered much of this, to the health and well being \\nof our communities, our environment, and our economy: Clean and \\nefficient drinking water and wastewater systems.\\n    All Americans deserve this. We deserve to have reliable, \\naffordable water and sanitation. I am very proud of the \\nbipartisan work of this Committee that we accomplished in the \\nlast Congress to address America's drinking water and \\nwastewater investment backlog. It is such a backlog. The DWWIA \\nAct, as we call it, was written by this Committee and is a key \\npillar of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. It \\ncreated new programs, opportunities, and support to address \\ncurrent water infrastructure needs and ongoing challenges in \\nsmall, rural, and disadvantaged communities.\\n    In this hearing, we will explore the current state of our \\nnation's water resources, the challenges that we face in \\nprotecting them, and how we can implement policies in the IIJA \\nto help ensure that every person has access to clean drinking \\nwater. I look forward to hearing from our expert witnesses and \\nengaging in a thoughtful and productive discussion on this \\ncrucial issue.\\n    The IIJA authorized $55 billion in funding, as the Chairman \\nsaid, the largest investment ever, for a range of water \\ninfrastructure programs, including grants for small and \\ndisadvantaged communities, funding for lead service line \\nreplacement, and support for innovative water technologies, as \\nwell as funding for wastewater treatment and stormwater \\nmanagement. These funding opportunities provide new resources \\nto address the current challenges facing our waters \\ninfrastructure.\\n    Many communities, certainly in our States, are grappling \\nwith aging infrastructure that is in need of repair or \\nreplacement, while others are dealing with emerging \\ncontaminants like PFAS that require specialized treatment \\ntechnologies. At the same time, small, rural, and disadvantaged \\ncommunities often lack the resources and technical expertise \\nneeded to address these challenges, leaving us very vulnerable \\nto water quality problems and public health risks.\\n    IIJA programs offer a wide range of funding opportunities \\nto help address these challenges, from grants and low interest \\nloans to technical assistance. These funds can support critical \\ninfrastructure upgrades including the replacement of lead \\nservice lines, the construction of new treatment facilities--I \\nhave actually toured some of these, as I think you have--and \\nthe implementation of advanced treatment technologies.\\n    Additionally, the funding can support capacity building \\ninitiatives, including work force development. Every water \\nsystem I go to is really down on the numbers of people who are \\ninterested in working in water, but also the retirements that \\nwe are seeing across the board in the work force is really \\nputting a strain on our systems. So we need to help there. We \\nneed to help communities build the expertise needed to manage \\nand maintain their water systems, and frankly, we need to get \\nthe next generation excited about this as an opportunity and a \\ncareer of the future.\\n    Despite these significant funding challenges, ongoing unmet \\nneeds in small, rural, and disadvantaged communities still \\nremain a concern. As they have said, they lack some of the \\ntechnical expertise. As we work to implement these programs, it \\nwill be important to ensure that the resources are targeted to \\nthe communities that need them the most and the necessary \\ntechnical assistance and training programs to support them.\\n    As the EPA begins to deploy these significant financial \\ninvestments in our infrastructure, I have concerns about how \\nthe agency is planning to implement some of the directives from \\nCongress. We were very explicit in our bills, I think. The \\nBiden administration has prioritized its environmental justice \\nagenda. But it has not been shy to pull in, I think, political \\nfactors as they are doing that that are unrelated to water \\nquality and health, key conditions for how this money should be \\nspent, and even funding for States as it is reviewed by the \\nagency. I am concerned that projects will not be considered \\nbased solely on needs related to the explicit statutory \\ndirectives of safeguarding human health, keeping rates \\naffordable, and protecting the environment.\\n    While all of us support empowering communities through \\neconomic development, it is important that we recognize that \\nFederal investments to the Safe Drinking Water Act and Clean \\nWater Act, as amended by the IIJA, should be directed to \\nprojects where the needs are most acute and in line with what \\nCongress directed the agency to do in the statute. We shouldn't \\nbe sidetracked from responsibly investing in our aging \\ninfrastructure because we have such a historic bipartisan \\nsuccess here.\\n    Water systems do not align neatly with the Administration's \\neffort to use census tracts to define EJ communities or \\npoliticizing the distribution of funds. We have run into this \\nin West Virginia in some of the definitions. Congress was \\nclear: Funding through DWWIA should encourage State flexibility \\nthrough funding pots like the SRFs, and other grant programs \\nshould prioritize the need.\\n    Funds were firewalled between systems of various sizes to \\nmake sure that rural communities, small towns, and big cities \\nall got their fair share without taking too big a slice of the \\npie. The EPA should implement these programs pursuant to the \\ncongressional intent, which resulted from some hard fought \\nbipartisan compromises.\\n    I am committed to working on these issues that are so \\nimportant to me, the citizens of West Virginia, and our \\ncountry.\\n    I will close by saying what everyone in attendance knows: \\nWater infrastructure investments are critical to public health, \\nenvironmental health, and economic development. I want to see \\nthese new investments create a better quality of life, create \\nmore jobs, and drive the kind of quality of shared health \\nbenefits that we all care about.\\n    I also want to welcome in the next panel Kathy Emery from \\nthe great State of West Virginia and also Raleigh County. She \\nis here with her husband Roy, her son Taylor, who goes to West \\nVirginia University, and her other son is a graduate student at \\nWest Virginia University, as well.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Carper. Thank you.\\n    To our visitors from Raleigh County, my grandfather, great-\\ngreat-great-grandfather was one of the co-founders of Raleigh \\nCounty. Our family was present at the creation. It is a special \\nhonor to have you here with all of us today.\\n    I ride back and forth on the train just about every day to \\nDelaware. The other day I was talking with someone, and he used \\nthese words to talk about integrity. He said, integrity, if you \\nhave it, nothing else matters. Integrity, if you don't have it, \\nnothing else matters. And the same, I think, could probably be \\nsaid of water. If we have it, we have good, clean drinking \\nwater, it is not that nothing else matters, but that is hugely, \\nhugely important to sustain life.\\n    As Governor, and I know my other colleagues have spent a \\nlot of time on economic development and job creation in their \\nStates, I never talked to a business large or small who was \\nlooking to locate or expand a business who was interested in \\ndoing so in a place that didn't have good, clean drinking \\nwater. It is just critical in order to be successful in job \\ncreation and maintaining those jobs.\\n    With that having been said, it is now time to hear from our \\nfirst panel. Joining us today is Radhika Fox, Assistant \\nAdministrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's \\nOffice of Water. In her role, Assistant Administrator Fox works \\nto ensure that drinking water is safe, wastewater is safely \\nreturned to the environment, and surface waters are properly \\nmanaged and protected.\\n    We thank you for the work that you do. You are recognized \\nand may proceed at this time. Thank you so much for joining us.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF HON. RADHIKA FOX, ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR, OFFICE \\n           OF WATER, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\\n\\n    Ms. Fox. Thank you so much, and good morning, Chairman \\nCarper, Ranking Member Capito, and members of the Committee. I \\nam so honored to join you to provide an update on EPA's \\nimplementation of historic water infrastructure investments \\nthrough the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\\n    Really, I just need to start by saying thank you. It really \\nis the bipartisan leadership of this Committee that was so \\ninstrumental in securing over $50 billion to invest in clean \\nand safe water in communities across America.\\n    I also want to take a moment to express my gratitude to the \\nincredible career staff at EPA who are really the ones \\nimplementing this. I have some of the leadership from the \\nOffice of Groundwater and Drinking Water here with me today. It \\nis really because of their dedication, their technical \\nexpertise, their hard work that we are delivering on the \\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law as promised to the American \\npeople.\\n    So let me give you a brief report out on how implementation \\nis going at the EPA. Congress provided the majority of the \\nwater funding through the State Revolving Loan Funds program, \\nthe SRFs, about $43 billion. In March 2022, EPA issued our SRF \\nimplementation memo. That document established key priorities \\nconsistent with the legislation that has really been our north \\nstar for how we have been implementing this bill.\\n    The key priorities that we outlined in that SRF \\nimplementation memo were, one, to provide flexibility to States \\nin meeting their local water needs, increasing investment in \\ndisadvantaged communities, making rapid progress on lead \\nservice line replacements, addressing PFAS and other emerging \\ncontaminants, advancing climate adaptation and mitigation, and \\nsupporting good jobs here in America.\\n    We engaged very closely with the States as we developed \\nthis implementation memo. We have a State SRF work group. And \\nthat has really set the foundation for a robust partnership \\nwith the States in implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure \\nLaw.\\n    So here we are about 1 year later, and I am delighted to \\nreport that 47 States and six Tribes and territories have \\nreceived nearly $5 billion in SRF funding in the first year. \\nThat is a big number, and I want to talk for a minute about \\nwhat that means for people and for local communities.\\n    For example, because of these investments, Sierra Vista RV \\nPark in Arizona will be able to remove arsenic and nitrates \\nfrom their drinking water. Local government leaders in Sussex \\nCounty, Delaware, will be able to connect hundreds of homes to \\na regional water system, which will also protect nearby marshes \\nalong the Delaware Bay. And in Pittsburgh, we are going to \\nremove nearly 1,000 lead pipes in low income and working class \\nneighborhoods.\\n    Those are just a couple of examples of the thousands of \\nprojects that are going to be funded by the SRFs. That is the \\nreal deal that we are delivering to America because of the \\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law.\\n    Let me touch on a couple of other highlights. The \\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law also established the Emerging \\nContaminants and Smaller Disadvantaged Communities Grant \\nProgram. Just a few weeks ago, we announced the first $2 \\nbillion funding available through that on a non-competitive \\nbasis available to all the States that want those resources. \\nVery excited about that.\\n    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is also investing nearly \\n$2 billion through the agency's Geographic National Estuary and \\nGulf Hypoxia programs. These investments are so wonderful. They \\nare supporting conservation, restoration, infrastructure \\nprograms to protect some of our nation's most treasured waters, \\nthe Chesapeake Bay, the Great Lakes, the Mississippi River \\nBasin, the Gulf of Mexico, the San Francisco Bay, really just \\nquite remarkable.\\n    We are also working, because of the Bipartisan \\nInfrastructure Law, to ensure that our groundwater is safe. We \\nare providing $50 million to help States develop and implement \\nunderground injection control classics program to support \\ncarbon capture and sequestration. We have a letter of inquiry \\non that process underway, where States can seek these resources \\nif they want primacy of the program. We are going to be \\nawarding funds to States by the end of this year.\\n    I want to conclude my remarks by emphasizing something that \\nboth you, Senator Capito, and Senator Carper said, and that is \\nthat we are really dedicated to ensuring that all communities \\nbenefit from this investment. We know there are too many small \\ncommunities, too many rural communities, too many underserved \\nurban distressed areas that have not received their fair share \\nof Federal funding. We can and we must do better. That is our \\nfocus at EPA.\\n    In addition to all of the work to get these resources out \\nto States and local communities, we have been standing up the \\nmost significant technical assistance program, because we think \\nthat is what will change the odds for communities who haven't \\nbeen able to get their fair share. We are actively working in \\ncommunities across the country from McDowell County, West \\nVirginia, to Lowndes County, Alabama, to communities all across \\nthe country. We have 29 environmental finance centers who are \\nproviding free technical assistance to communities that want \\nit. We have our Closing the Wastewater Access Gap initiative, \\nwe have our Lead Service Line Accelerators.\\n    All of these technical assistance programs are helping \\nbuild that local community capacity to make sure we are \\nunlocking these resources for every community, so that every \\ncommunity has clean and safe water.\\n    Let me end where I began, which is to say thank you. Thank \\nyou so much for the opportunity to steward these resources. It \\nis because of Congress and President Biden that you have \\ncreated a transformational moment right now, a transformational \\nopportunity for the water sector. I want you to know that EPA \\nis working hard, we are working strategically to deliver on the \\nvision that you set in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. We \\nare working to make sure that water funding benefits all \\nAmericans, no matter where they live, how much money they have \\nin their bank account, or the color of their skin.\\n    I want to thank you again for the opportunity to serve the \\nAmerican people in this way. I look forward to today's \\ndiscussion. Thank you.\\n    [The prepared statement of Ms. Fox follows:]\\n    \\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n    \\n    Senator Carper. Thank you very much for being here today, \\nand for your leadership, and the hard work that has been done \\nand is being done within EPA especially on these issues.\\n    Again, we want to say to our staffs who are sitting behind \\nus and those who are back in their offices how much we \\nappreciate their work on these issues as well.\\n    Senator Capito, my Ranking Member here, I want to say again \\nhow proud I was of our Committee last week with our hearing on \\nthe derailment in East Palestine. I thought it was a wonderful \\nhearing, and bipartisan and penetrating and something that sets \\nthe stage for making sure that the people of East Palestine and \\nthat part of America are treated the way we would want to be \\ntreated. I am very, very proud, and thank you for all of that.\\n    Let me start with some questions, if I can, for Ms. Fox. We \\nhave mentioned PFAS a time or two in today's hearing. I want to \\nreturn to it. EPA yesterday released, as we know, the proposed \\ndrinking water standard for six types of PFAS chemicals. I want \\nto commend you and Administrator Regan for your leadership in \\nproposing a standard that is based in science and a standard \\nthat protects the public to the maximum extent possible.\\n    These forever chemicals are prolific throughout the \\nenvironment. Under President Biden's leadership, EPA has taken \\nanother significant step to address their presence in our water \\nwith yesterday's decision.\\n    Question: Ms. Fox, can you please give us some more \\nbackground on the standard and explain the next step for the \\nagency's action in this regard?\\n    Ms. Fox. Thank you for the question, Senator. I want to \\nthank you and Senator Capito and other members of this \\nCommittee who have kept us focused on getting this drinking \\nwater standard proposed. I was talking to Senator Capito \\nyesterday, and said, in the 2 years that we have had \\nconversations, I don't think there is a single time that we \\nspoke where you don't ask about this. We are really, truly \\nthrilled to be at this key milestone.\\n    The science on PFAS is clear. Exposure, even at very low \\nlevels, is very harmful to human health. What we also know \\nabout the science is that people are exposed to PFAS from a \\nvariety of means, from their air, their land, and their water. \\nBut when PFAS is in drinking water, we know it is one of the \\nmost significant contributors to the harmful health effects \\nthat people face. So as we think about making progress on this \\ncritical issue for the American people, having a national \\ndrinking water standard that keeps PFAS out of our drinking \\nwater, that is one of the best things that we can do as a \\nnation from a human health perspective.\\n    We are very proud of the proposal that we announced \\nyesterday. It is based in the latest peer reviewed science, and \\nscience is evolving rapidly as it relates to PFAS. It is \\ngrounded in the latest peer reviewed science. It also learned \\nfrom the dozen States that already have established MCLs for \\nPFAS in drinking water.\\n    As you said, Senator, the proposal calls for regulating six \\nPFAS. We are proposing to set an MCL, maximum contaminant \\nlevel, of four parts per trillion for PFOA and PFOS. Four parts \\nper trillion is the level at which we can detected PFAS in our \\ndrinking water. We have laboratory capacity to do that.\\n    We also are proposing to regulate four additional PFAS as a \\nmixture. These four PFAS are known to co-occur in drinking \\nwater. This is GENX, PFES, PFNX, PFE, an alphabet soup of PFAS. \\nBut with those four, we are setting a hazard index for those \\nfour PFAS.\\n    Also, some of the other features of the rule proposal that \\nwe are very pleased with is the public notification \\nrequirements, which is so important, so that the American \\npeople can know. We have developed a flexible approach to \\nmonitoring and compliance, recognizing that water systems are \\nin different places.\\n    The next steps are a 60 day comment period. So we are very \\nmuch looking forward to engaging with our State co-regulators, \\nlocal water systems, community organizations, to get feedback \\non this proposal. We are really working hard to get to a final \\nrule by the end of 2023 or very early in 2024.\\n    Again, I thank this Committee for your wonderful leadership \\non PFAS.\\n    Senator Carper. You are welcome. It is a shared \\nresponsibility.\\n    As you know, we all are on multiple committees. One of my \\ncommittees is having what we call a business session right now. \\nThey need me there for a quorum. I have asked Senator Capito if \\nshe would preside in my absence, and she has graciously agreed \\nto do so.\\n    Keep an eye on Senator Cramer in my absence. I know that is \\na big job.\\n    Thanks for your responses to my question, and Senator \\nCapito, I will be back as fast as I can. Thanks so much.\\n    Senator Capito [presiding]. Thank you.\\n    Assistant Administrator Fox, you and I talked about this \\nyesterday on the phone. This is a bit in the weeds. You came \\nout several months ago, or maybe a year ago, with what was \\ncalled a health advisory level for the PFOAs which were so low \\nthat, unmeasurable, systems were unable to measure as to what \\nthe EPA was saying would be a health advisory level.\\n    You come back now with the MCL, which I am really pleased \\nthat we are here today to talk about that, at 4. It is \\nsignificantly higher than what you previously said the health \\nadvisory level would be.\\n    I asked this question, how did you base, what science was \\nthe basis for these health advisory levels. Yesterday I got, or \\nthe day before, an 1,800 page response from you and the EPA, \\nwhich was difficult to go through because it had a lot of \\nattached reports and everything with it.\\n    What I am worried about is the risk communication. What \\ndoes this mean to somebody who is actually trying to determine \\nif their system is safe, and how it is going to impact the \\nhealth and the drinking water standards? I am going to submit \\nquestions to you in writing, because this is going to get a \\nlittle bit technical, and I don't want to take up all my time \\non technicalities. So if you could respond to those when I send \\nthem, I would very much appreciate that.\\n    Ms. Fox. Yes, I would be happy to.\\n    Senator Capito. Great, thank you.\\n    Let me ask again on the PFOA and PFAS issue, we have set \\nthe drinking level, we are going to probably have requirements \\nfor systems to test to this level and compliance. There is \\ngoing to be a lot of instances of what we would call passive \\nreceivers, somebody who, basically a water system who receives \\nthe water from a source and passes the water on, and maybe the \\nlevel is a little bit higher. I am worried about the liability \\nissues. I know you are not in charge of CERCLA, but have you \\nall thought about this and what kinds of issues we might be \\naddressing here at the Congress in terms of the passive \\nliability issue for PFAS?\\n    Ms. Fox. You are correct, thank you for that question. On \\nthe CERCLA hazard designation, that is of course in our Office \\nof Land and Emergency Management. But one thing that is \\nparticularly exciting about how we are approaching the issue of \\nPFAS at the agency is we really are taking a whole of agency \\napproach. The Office of Water team has engaged closely with the \\nOffice of Land and Emergency Management on these issues of \\npassive liability. Certainly, drinking water systems, \\nwastewater systems, PFAS has entered these systems, and they \\nare not the responsible party.\\n    So as that CERCLA hazardous designation rule continues to \\nmove forward, the agency is thinking about enforcement \\ndiscretion and what is appropriate, just as we do with other \\nCERCLA designations.\\n    Right now, though, is such an exciting moment to be moving \\nthis drinking water rule forward, because we also have the \\nresources in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are working \\nvery actively with States and local communities to make sure \\nthe $9 billion that you all dedicated to addressing PFAS and \\nemerging contaminants is out there, that water systems are \\naccessing those funds, getting these treatment technologies in \\nplace. I think that is going to make a huge difference as we \\nmove forward.\\n    Senator Capito. What would you say to every State in terms \\nof the retention of the flexibilities that are built into the \\nsystems on the revolving funds? Once those revolving funds \\nleave DC and go to our States like West Virginia, is all the \\nresponsibility in the State then? That is what I would prefer. \\nHow do you see that?\\n    Ms. Fox. I really see it as a partnership. We have been \\nvery clear in our implementation memo around the Bipartisan \\nInfrastructure Law that we value the flexibility that States \\nhave always had with the SRS. Senator Capito, if you look at \\nthe thousands of projects that are on these intended use plans, \\nthey are so diverse. They are funding drinking water, \\nwastewater, stormwater, small projects, big projects, \\ncybersecurity.\\n    The States are very much in the driver's seat in selecting \\nthe projects that really meet the needs of their residents. I \\nthink we have preserved that.\\n    It is also a partnership. It is our obligation for \\noversight and to make sure that States are utilizing various \\nresources in a way that is consistent with the legislation and \\nthe statute. An example of that is around disadvantaged \\ncommunities.\\n    One of the things that we talked about in the SRF \\nimplementation memo is, we summarize that of course, States are \\nthe ones that determine definition of disadvantaged \\ncommunities, both on the Clean Water SRF side as well as the \\nDrinking Water SRF side. To be helpful, in that implementation \\nmemo we laid out criteria that tend to be good criteria that \\nStates are utilizing in those definitions, and then ones that \\nmay be more problematic. And what is so exciting is that a \\nnumber of States sort of chose to amend their definition of \\ndisadvantaged communities. So we are seeing this trend line of \\nthose definitions really being consistent with the statute, the \\nSafe Drinking Water Act and Clean Water Act.\\n    Ultimately, it is a partnership, but yes, absolutely, the \\nStates are in the driver's seat in selecting the projects that \\nbest meet the needs in their borders.\\n    Senator Capito. I appreciate that answer. I think part of \\nyour answer went to what my opening statement was saying, that \\nthe States need to be in the driver's seat, the States are \\ngoing to be able to make the best determinations. I think what \\nwe have seen, not just at EPA but also over at Transportation, \\nis the Administration is putting the foot on the pedal here in \\ncertain instances, and suggesting certain parameters that then \\nlead to our States wondering if we don't go the way that EPA is \\nsaying, then are we going to have some kind of, I don't want to \\nsay penalty, but are we being guided by other issues that \\nreally, if we were doing it on our own, we wouldn't be doing it \\nquite this way. I think that is a cautionary tale.\\n    Senator Cramer.\\n    Senator Cramer. Thank you, Senator, and thank you, \\nAdministrator Fox, for being here.\\n    I have a lot of things to thank you for, so bear with me as \\nI do a little bit of that. First of all, I don't think it can \\nbe overstated how important your trip to North Dakota was in \\n2021. And while we had a robust discussion about the WOTUS \\nrule, and I will want to ask you some things about that here in \\na little bit, probably the most fun was nerding out a little \\nbit with the locals and the State water people, going through a \\nwater plant. It was wonderful.\\n    Most importantly, you listened to people and related to \\nthem. I thank you for that trip. It meant a lot, both the \\nnerding out and the WOTUS stuff.\\n    I also want to thank you, since then you have remained \\nconnected. You have always been available when I have had a \\nquestion. I have tried to answer the calls when you make them, \\nand every now and then we just bump into each other. I think it \\nis important that people see that relationships matter, even \\nwhere there is disagreement. And I appreciate that.\\n    You and your team clarified some things for my constituents \\nin pretty short order, for a massive bureaucracy like yours. I \\nwant to thank you for that as well. As you know, working with \\nthe SRF, the State Revolving Fund provisions of the \\nInfrastructure Bill, our State agency that oversees SRF, along \\nwith a variety of other stakeholders, of course, in the water \\nsector, raised concerns over the effective date of the Build \\nAmerica provisions.\\n    In particular, there were different effective dates for \\nWIFIA and SRF. Of course, these obviously are different \\nprograms; Same agency, but different programs, but similar \\ngoals. That kind of confusion oftentimes relates to gas, and \\nsometimes people just throw up their hands and give up.\\n    But after a couple of inquiries with State officials, your \\nteam reconciled the effective dates. Imagine that. A good, \\nsimple solution to the issue. It is going to allow projects in \\nNorth Dakota, and I presume other places, but in North Dakota \\nit has moved forward. I want to thank you and your team for \\nclearing that up. It is good public service.\\n    I do want to ask, and I know this isn't about Waters of the \\nU.S. necessarily, but we don't get the opportunity often \\nenough. I know that Administrator Regan will be in front of us \\nfor the really tough questions. We will both spare you those.\\n    I wanted to bring up a couple of issues, because at that \\nsame meeting in 2021, we heard from stakeholders. And since the \\nagency unveiled the rule, I have heard from a lot of those \\nstakeholders, constituents and others, who are concerned that \\nthe new rule really embodies some of the same government \\noverreach of the 2015 rule. I know there are some distinctions, \\nand you certainly are going to clarify some of them, I am sure.\\n    Anything that defers to the bureaucracy, we just get \\nconcerned about, because we have never really met a regulatory \\nagency that didn't regulate when given the opportunity.\\n    But also concerning was the rule's shift in applying the \\nburden of proof. This is a very specific issue, the burden of \\nproof on the landowners for proving that their land is non-\\njurisdictional, so on these jurisdictional questions. Can you \\nexplain why it does that? The previous rule, the Trump rule in \\nits preamble states emphatically that the burden of proof is \\nnot on the landowner but rather on the agency. Your rule seems \\nto have flipped that. Can you explain that to me a little bit?\\n    Ms. Fox. Yes, I am happy to. I just want to thank you for \\nyour hospitality. It was a wonderful visit to North Dakota. And \\nI appreciate the feedback about the team's work with your State \\nSRF program.\\n    I have to say, Senator, North Dakota is doing a fabulous \\njob with implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law \\nresources. They have already taken all of their CAP grants for \\nyear one. They are moving fast on their intended use plans.\\n    So it has been a great partnership. There are going to be \\nsome great, great projects that are funded in North Dakota. I \\ncan't wait to come back out for some of those groundbreakings \\nas well.\\n    On Waters of the United States, thank you for the \\nopportunity to clarify this question that you raised. And thank \\nyou for hosting me in North Dakota. We just received so much \\nvaluable information from the wide array of stakeholders you \\nbrought together on Waters of the United States.\\n    I am really proud of where we landed on this rule. I think \\nboth in my confirmation hearing, and Administrator Regan, when \\nhe had his confirmation hearing, we both talked about how our \\npriority was to stop the ping-pong with Waters of the United \\nStates, and to put forward a balanced rule that provided clear \\nrules of the road to farmers, to ranchers, to landowners, to \\ndevelopers. And we have done that.\\n    Our rule is not the Obama Clean Water Rule. It is a much \\nmore narrow definition of Waters of the United States than the \\nObama Rule. It is not the Trump Navigable Waters Rule either, \\nwhich as you know was vacated by multiple courts, and it was \\noff the books as of August 2021.\\n    One of the things that we really focused on in the \\ndevelopment of our rule was practical implementation \\nconsiderations. That is what I heard when I was in North \\nDakota. And on this landowner question, a couple of things that \\nI would share. One is that as part of our 2023 rule, we have a \\nwhole landowners guide that makes it very easy for landowners \\nto understand what is, if a permit might be needed or not.\\n    We also have worked closely with Army Corps where they can \\nprovide free jurisdictional determinations to any landowner \\nthat asks for them and to do that quickly. So that is a key \\nfeature.\\n    One of the things I am most proud about as far as our 2020 \\nrule is we also clarified what is out. So in the rule, we \\ncodified eight exclusions that we heard in places like North \\nDakota are very important, for example, with prior converted \\ncropland. This is something that so many farmers and ranchers \\nhave said, it is confusing.\\n    So in the rule, we have made that a categorical exemption, \\nvery clear. And w We partnered very closely with USDA on that \\nbecause we thought it was also really important that our \\ndefinitions between the different agencies are aligned. That is \\nwhy USDA is so supportive of this particular rule.\\n    Finally, again, the focus on implementation versus fighting \\nabout the definition at the Federal level is really a priority \\nmoving forward. One thing that we did is, as we issued our \\nfinal rule, we also issued a series of implementation \\nmemoranda. Some of them are between EPA and Army, where we are \\ndoing trainings to make sure that there is a consistent \\nunderstanding of this definition.\\n    We also have a coordination, an MOU with USDA, again on how \\ndo we make sure some of these programs are aligned for the \\nagriculture community.\\n    Senator, I believe we have delivered on what we said we \\nwould do. No more ping-pong, let's find the center, let's give \\npeople clear rules of the road as it relates to Waters of the \\nUnited States. Then also to make sure we are protecting those \\nvital water resources. I hope you see that we have struck that \\nbalance. We certainly have tried.\\n    Senator Cramer. I appreciate that. I am sure I am the last \\nRepublican who will ask you about waters today.\\n    [Laughter.]\\n    Senator Cramer. Thank you.\\n    Senator Capito. Thank you.\\n    Senator Cardin.\\n    Senator Cardin. Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate it \\nvery much.\\n    Let me thank the Administrator. Thank you for your \\nleadership on these issues. I appreciate the engagement you \\nhave had with our office. These are exciting times. We have \\nopportunities that we have not seen in generations to deal with \\nour water infrastructure.\\n    We all know the current status of our water infrastructure, \\nwhether it is drinking water or wastewater, it is not where it \\nneeds to be. We consistently get grades that are unacceptable. \\nI use Baltimore City as an example. Baltimore City had the best \\ndrinking water system in the world 100 years ago. \\nUnfortunately, some of those pipes are still underground today \\nand are being used.\\n    So we have challenges in Baltimore; we have challenges \\nthroughout our country. One of the major parts of the \\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law and increasing the resources \\ngoing into the State Revolving Funds was to direct your efforts \\nto traditionally underserved communities, communities that have \\nan affordability issue with regard to doing the necessary \\ninfrastructure that is critical to drinking water and \\nwastewater treatment.\\n    Tell me how you are going about reaching those communities \\nthat have had challenges in the past being able to afford the \\nnecessary improvements to their water systems, carrying out the \\nintent of Congress.\\n    Ms. Fox. Thank you for that question. We are doing a couple \\nof things. One is, one of the most exciting features of the \\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law is that you all provided about 49 \\npercent of resources must be spent for, be put out as grants \\nand principal forgiveness in disadvantaged communities. I think \\nyour vision in designing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has \\nunlocked so much potential.\\n    The challenge, Senator, is that disadvantaged communities \\noften don't have the financial capacity to access the loan \\naspect of the SRFs. So by putting so much money out as grants \\nand principal forgiveness, you have removed one of the critical \\nbarriers that these communities face.\\n    But we know that just having the resources available isn't \\nenough. That is why we have stood up the ambitious technical \\nassistance program alongside the capital projects that we are \\nfunding. We have built out our environmental finance centers; \\nwe have 29 of them. Every region, EPA region, has an \\nenvironmental finance center as well as national ones. They are \\nbasically available to any community that wants technical \\nassistance in order to access the SRF funds.\\n    As we design that technical assistance effort, I thought \\nabout when I worked at a local water utility, I was at the San \\nFrancisco Public Utilities Commission, and there we had access \\nto all of the best engineering, design, financial planning. A \\ndisadvantaged community doesn't have access to those things, \\nbut they need that in order to get these SRF funds.\\n    So we are basically making that available to any community \\nthat wants them. We just opened up our TA web page, so I would \\nlove to share that information with the Committee so that you \\ncan share it with your constituents.\\n    We are going to be helping thousands of communities access \\nthese SRF dollars. Really, that is the core of the strategy, \\nproviding that technical assistance support, so that these \\ndisadvantaged communities can build their technical, financial, \\nand managerial capacity.\\n    Senator Cardin. I want to follow up with you as to how that \\nis being implemented. We have jurisdictions like Baltimore City \\nwhere the ratepayer support is just inadequate to deal with the \\nneeds that we have, because of income. Then we have communities \\nlike Smith Island, which are so isolated that they just don't \\nhave the population to be able to support the water that they \\nneed without greater assistance.\\n    So we have different needs in our State. I am sure that is \\ntrue throughout the country. Technical assistance would be \\ncritically important. But also making sure the resources get to \\nthose communities. Please keep us informed, and I will be \\nworking with you on that.\\n    I want to ask you one other question about the low income \\nwater assistance program. We provided $3 million in the fiscal \\nyear 2023 omnibus for you to conduct a low income water \\nassistance needs assessment. Senator Wicker and I have worked \\non the realities that water bills are beyond the capacity of \\nmany ratepayers today. We have a low income utility assistance \\nprogram under LIHEAP, but we think there is a need for one \\nunder water. How are you implementing that needs assessment?\\n    Ms. Fox. Thank you for that question, and you are \\nabsolutely right. This issue of water affordability, even \\nthough the $50 billion in funding from the Federal Government \\nwill make a huge difference, water affordability is a growing \\nchallenge in communities across the country. In my former role \\nas CEO for the U.S. Water Alliance, I helped create this water \\nequity and affordability network.\\n    As to the assessment, we are currently, we are going to \\npartner with HHS in the development of that assessment, since \\nthey are managing the LIWAP program. We are currently designing \\nthe methodology for that assessment, and it is going to get \\nunderway very soon. And I am happy to keep your office, Senator \\nCardin, and Senator Wicker's offices up to date on how that \\nassessment is going.\\n    In addition to that, we are working closely to support HHS \\nas they continue to administer the LIWAP program, which we are \\nso grateful was developed by this Congress.\\n    Senator Cardin. Thank you. I would appreciate it if you \\nwould keep me informed.\\n    Madam Chair, I have a unanimous consent request on behalf \\nof the Chairman. I ask unanimous consent to enter into the \\nrecord a letter from the American Sustainable Business Network \\nwhich represents more than 400 businesses that rely upon clean \\nwater. This diverse coalition of businesses includes breweries, \\nmattress companies, and farms. The letter expresses opposition \\nto efforts they used in the Congressional Review Act to \\noverturn the 2023 WOTUS rule.\\n    Senator Capito. Without objection.\\n    [The referenced information follows:]\\n    \\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n    \\n    Senator Cardin. Thank you.\\n    Senator Capito. Senator Lummis.\\n    Senator Lummis. Thank you, Madam Chairman.\\n    Welcome, Administrator Fox.\\n    I was so pleased to hear Senator Cramer compliment you on \\nthe relationship that you formed with problem solving in North \\nDakota. I am hoping you can help me similarly with a couple \\nissues I have today that I would like to discuss with you about \\nsanitary survey results.\\n    My office has heard repeatedly from constituents that are \\nfrustrated with delays from the EPA on sanitary survey results. \\nI have close to a dozen towns or small water systems that have \\nwaited, some as long as 26 months, to get survey results that \\nwere conducted in the summer of 2020. These delays make it \\nreally difficult for these communities, because some are \\ngetting results not long before a new survey is required.\\n    Can you commit to getting the survey results out within \\nbetter timeframes? Ideally it would be 60 days after \\ncompletion. But these surveys take a long time for these \\ncommunities to fill out, especially small water systems. And \\nthen there is a delay, and they need the feedback sooner, \\nbecause as soon as they get these results, they are going on \\ninto another survey.\\n    Ms. Fox. Thank you so much for making me aware of this \\nissue. Yes, you have my commitment that I will personally look \\ninto the 12 water systems that you mentioned that are waiting. \\nThe sanitary survey, you are right, Senator, it is a very \\nimportant tool that States and local water systems and the EPA \\nutilize. And local water systems need that information in order \\nto make key operational maintenance management decisions.\\n    So yes, I will commit to looking into the situation with \\nthese 12, as well as just looking more broadly into the \\ntimeline for returning that information.\\n    Senator Lummis. Thanks very much. I really do appreciate \\nthat.\\n    I also have another question about the topic of sanitary \\nsurveys. Madam Chairman, I would like to enter into the record \\na letter, asking unanimous consent to enter into the record a \\nletter to Administrator Regan dated January 25th, 2023, \\nconcerning the EPA's memorandum to State drinking water \\nadministrators on public water systems cybersecurity.\\n    Senator Capito. Without objection.\\n    [The referenced information was not received at time of \\nprint.]\\n    Senator Lummis. Thank you. This letter addresses the EPA's \\nplan to add cybersecurity requirements to the sanitary survey \\nprogram. Now, we all agree that cybersecurity is incredibly \\nimportant for water systems. But it is doing it as part of the \\nsanitary survey program that has raised issues.\\n    The organizations that signed the letter I just entered \\ninto the record have called that plan ill advised, impractical, \\nand not designed to meaningfully improve system resiliency. \\nEPA's approach is also legally flawed. That is what the letter \\nsays. And then they go on to ask for the EPA to recall the \\nmemorandum.\\n    The signatories to that letter include the American Water \\nWorks Association, National Association of Clean Water \\nAgencies, National Rural Water Association, U.S. Conference of \\nMayors, National Association of Counties, and others. So \\nobviously, this has received a lot of review from local \\ngovernance, and they are concerned about just using this survey \\nas the source for gathering that information.\\n    Can you talk about what outreach was done concerning this \\nmemorandum?\\n    Ms. Fox. Yes, I am happy to do that. Senator, you are \\nabsolutely right, that cybersecurity threats to water systems, \\nit is a growing concern that is happening with more frequency. \\nThere are bad actors out there, and this is a significant \\nvulnerability to our water systems.\\n    We believe that in order to protect our water systems from \\ncyberthreats, we have to take a multi-faceted approach. That is \\nexactly what we have been doing at EPA. For example, we have \\nbeen encouraging water systems to consider using SRF funds to \\ndo those cybersecurity upgrades. In the President's budget, he \\nhas requested additional resources for a grant program to help \\nwater systems get in compliance. We do many, many trainings and \\nresources that are out there all the time.\\n    We feel that this implementation memo that I recently \\nissued is also a critical part of the solution. The sanitary \\nsurvey is really the primary tool by which a State can really \\nassess the operational capacities of a local water system. \\nGiven the critical nature of having good cybersecurity \\npractices, we felt that this needed to be, in this modern age, \\none of the operational considerations that States look at in \\nthese surveys.\\n    We had a very robust process. We actually asked one of the \\nAssociation of State Drinking Water Administrators, we had a \\nwork group process with them. They reviewed the memo. We had \\nmany, many consultations all along the way. And we are not just \\nissuing a memo without support. There is a whole series of \\nresources that are being developed, key questions that can \\neasily be added by the State to these sanitary surveys. So we \\nthink this is very doable, very achievable, a good, key step \\nforward to protect our water systems from cyberthreats, which \\nagain are growing.\\n    Senator Lummis. I would encourage you, because of the \\nletter that was addressed to Director Regan, to have more \\nconversations with the local implementers. Because it is a \\npretty broad association of locals that are saying, the \\nsanitary survey program is just the wrong tool to have this \\ndialogue.\\n    Clearly, there is some sort of disconnect going on between \\nthe local implementers and EPA on this. So I would ask for your \\ncareful reconsideration or at least extending your dialogue \\nwith those folks.\\n    My time is up, Madam Chairman. I will submit a question \\nabout drinking water loss in municipal systems due to faulty \\nand leaky infrastructure, and ask for a response in writing.\\n    Thank you so much for being here.\\n    Ms. Fox. Thank you, Senator.\\n    Senator Carper [presiding]. Senator Lummis, thank you for \\nthose questions.\\n    Next, we have been joined by Senator Kelly.\\n    Senator Kelly, good morning, and welcome.\\n    Senator Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Good morning, Administrator Fox. It is nice to see you here \\ntoday. And thank you for the conversation we had yesterday.\\n    I want to start off by discussing the recently finalized \\nrule by EPA and the Army Corps on the definition of Waters of \\nthe United States. As you know, there has been a push by some \\nin Congress to use the Congressional Review Act, a CRA, to \\nrepeal this rule. You and I discussed some of my concerns here, \\nand those of Senator Sinema. The two of us sent a detailed \\nletter to EPA and the Corps last week with some specific \\nimplementation questions.\\n    But I want to talk for a minute about what would happen if \\nthe CRA passed. We are going to have a vote on it. So if it \\npassed, I want to start with a few yes/no questions.\\n    So if the 2023 WOTUS rule were repealed, would the Trump \\nera Navigable Waters Protection rule take effect?\\n    Ms. Fox. No, it would not. Because it was vacated in August \\n2021, by a Federal court.\\n    Senator Kelly. And would the 2025 Obama era WOTUS rule take \\neffect?\\n    Ms. Fox. No, it would not.\\n    Senator Kelly. So my understanding is the rule that would \\nbe in effect would be something similar to the pre-2015 WOTUS \\nguidance, is that correct?\\n    Ms. Fox. That is correct, Senator.\\n    Senator Kelly. And that guidance, my understanding is that \\nit relies on the same types of significant nexus test as the \\nWOTUS rule that EPA and the Army Corps finalized this January, \\nis that right?\\n    Ms. Fox. Yes, but there are key differences in how we \\napproach it.\\n    Senator Kelly. Can you explain those differences?\\n    Ms. Fox. Yes, sir. The CRA, if it were to pass, it would as \\nyou said put us back to the pre-2015 definition of Waters of \\nthe United States. That definition is broader than our 2023 \\nrule; our 2023 rule is more narrow in the definition of Waters \\nof the United States. It is more uncertain. So there would be \\nkey challenges.\\n    With a CRA, you can't sort of take parts of the rule that \\nwork and parts that don't that people might have concerns \\nabout. It wipes out the entire rule and puts back in place the \\n2015.\\n    So we would, for example, on the question of the two test \\nsignificant nexus, and relatively permanent, in our 2023 rule, \\nsignificant nexus is much more narrowly defined than in 2015. \\nAnd it would be utilized only in a very small number of waters, \\nwhereas it would be much more broad in the 2015 versus the \\n2023.\\n    Another challenge if the CRA would pass is that many of the \\nexemptions and exclusions that I was talking to Senator Cramer \\nabout just a moment ago, those would all be voided out. And \\nbecause the CRA says that agencies cannot ever adopt a rule \\nthat is similar in the future, we may never be able to ever \\nbring back things like prior converted crop or exemptions for \\nartificial ponds, things like that. So it would really create \\nconfusion, uncertainty, and void the very common sense aspects \\nof the rule that we worked so hard to put in place.\\n    Senator Kelly. So the things we did in the 2023 rule, that \\nactually made it narrower?\\n    Ms. Fox. Yes.\\n    Senator Kelly. If we go back to the 2015, and we do it \\nthrough the CRA process, in the future we couldn't use those \\nsame items as you just addressed to get a narrower definition \\nof Waters of the United States?\\n    Ms. Fox. That is correct. Agencies are prevented from \\nissuing anything that is similar.\\n    Senator Kelly. So this took us a while to sort through. It \\nis not an obvious thing, how sometimes you can, through a CRA \\nprocess, you are trying to get an outcome that might be \\nnarrower, and in fact you have some unintended consequences. \\nAnd I think that is the case here. Is that your sense?\\n    Ms. Fox. That is absolutely the case. We would be throwing \\nout a narrower definition of Waters of the United States. We \\nwould be throwing out all of the implementation direction that \\nwe provided. We would be throwing out the collaboration memos \\nbetween USDA and EPA and Army Corps that will help with good \\nimplementation. We would be going back to a broader definition \\nof significant nexus.\\n    It would create a great deal of uncertainty in communities \\nacross the country. We believe it would lead to delays in \\npermitting important projects, permitting infrastructure \\nprojects, developing happening on land. And so it is not the \\nright tool.\\n    We can always improve on Waters of the United States. We \\nwelcome that conversation with this Committee. We are also \\nlaser sharp focused on doing implementation work in a way that \\naddresses the regional differences across the country. We would \\nlose all of that if this rule gets CRAd.\\n    Senator Kelly. Thank you, Administrator Fox.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Carper. Thank you, Senator Kelly, for that line of \\nquestioning. Some important points were made there.\\n    Ms. Fox, thank you for your responses to them.\\n    I mentioned this earlier; one of the things that this \\nCommittee looks forward to is certainty and predictability. \\nThat has always been the case, and I think it is the case \\nstill.\\n    Senator Ricketts, you have been patient. Thanks a lot for \\njoining us.\\n    We have been joined by Senator Sullivan as well.\\n    Thank you, and you are recognized for your questions.\\n    Senator Ricketts. Thank you very much, Chairman Carper, \\nRanking Member Capito, thank you very much, and Administrator \\nFox, thanks very much for joining us.\\n    Having been Governor, one of the things that I am very well \\naware of is water infrastructure and how challenging it can be, \\nas Senator Cardin said, not just for big cities but also \\nespecially in Nebraska, small, rural communities. Obviously, \\nthe EPA has, on Tuesday, released its first national standard \\nfor six PFAS levels for drinking water. Small water systems, \\nagain, often don't have the technical capability for dealing \\nwith these and implementing these sorts of monitoring \\nrequirements.\\n    How do you plan to assist small water systems, especially \\nin rural areas, for doing the testing and compliance for being \\nable to comply with this rulemaking?\\n    Ms. Fox. Thank you for that question. This is a huge \\npriority for us in the Office of Water, how do we broadly make \\nsure that smaller water systems, rural systems benefit broadly \\nfrom the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and everything that we \\nare doing on this question of PFAS specifically.\\n    There are a couple of things. One is that we have recently \\nstarted our UCMR 5, which is an ongoing monitoring program. \\nHistorically, larger water systems do that. It is harder for \\nsmaller systems. We advocated for resources so that smaller \\nsystems could do that. Because of the generosity of Congress, \\nwe have resources now to work with smaller systems on that.\\n    In the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, there is a new $5 \\nbillion grant program that is dedicated to small systems and \\ndisadvantaged communities to basically look at issues of PFAS \\nand other emerging contaminants. So that is going to be \\nresources that are dedicated to the very communities that you \\nare asking about, Senator. Those resources can help other grant \\nprograms, so you don't have to pay anything back. They can use \\nthat for testing, for remediation, implementing treatment \\ntechnologies. So that is going to make a huge difference.\\n    What we have learned in our work across rural America is \\nthat just getting resources, making resources available isn't \\nenough. You have got to support smaller systems, rural systems, \\nin building their technical, financial, and managerial capacity \\nto be able to both get that grant or get that loan, and then be \\nable to implement it well.\\n    That is why we are spending so much time building out the \\ntechnical assistance infrastructure. We have 29 environmental \\nfinance centers. We have actually increased our contracts with \\nNational Rural Water and with RCAP, the Rural Community \\nAssistance Program, because they have direct touch points in \\nrural America. So they are going to be doing even more \\ntechnical assistance in these areas.\\n    So that is some of what we have underway. And we think it \\nis really going to change the odds in rural America.\\n    Senator Ricketts. So how would a smaller community be able \\nto access some of those resources you are talking about?\\n    Ms. Fox. We have just put up a technical assistance web \\npage on our website. I would be happy to share that information \\nwith your office.\\n    Senator Ricketts. Please do.\\n    Ms. Fox. Then also, we are working very closely with the \\nStates. Many States also have technical assistance programs. So \\nwe are trying to coordinate. Your environmental secretary, your \\nSRF State manager, they are going to know the communities that \\nare out of compliance; they are going to know the communities \\nthat are keeping them up at night as it relates to clean, safe \\nwater.\\n    So we are asking them. We are building this list of \\ncommunities. And then we are not waiting for people, for a \\ncommunity to come to us. When we hear from a State or a local \\nwater system that something is of concern, we are having our \\ntechnical assistance providers actively reach out to them. So \\nwe have to go to the community, not just wait for them to ask \\nfor help.\\n    Senator Ricketts. Great, thank you. I am running out of \\ntime here, so I am just going to talk about another thing we \\nwere talking about with some of the investments for these \\ncommunities. The intent of these funds was to help communities \\nthat need the most to be able to get the resources. My \\nunderstanding, though, is that some communities feel like there \\nhave been other priorities put in there with regard to climate \\nrather than safe drinking water.\\n    Is that something you feel is being pushed in the \\nlegislation? That was not Congress's intent. Or do you feel \\npeople are just taking this the wrong way? What is your \\nresponse when you hear some of those criticisms?\\n    Ms. Fox. I do think it is a misunderstanding, Senator. We \\nhave been very clear in our implementation memo and in all of \\nour discussions that the States are in the driver's seat in \\nmaking decisions around the SRF program. Because they know what \\ncommunities need those resources the most.\\n    So we have been clear on that. We certainly encourage \\nclimate considerations. But it is not a requirement. Certainly \\nin places like Oklahoma, drought is a top concern. So, \\ncertainly projects that are going to help water supply \\ndiversification and conservation ground water re-use and \\nrecharge, these are things that are going to really matter in \\ncommunities.\\n    But no, the States are in the driver's seat as far as \\nselecting projects.\\n    Senator Ricketts. Great. Thank you very much.\\n    Ms. Fox. Thank you.\\n    Senator Carper. Senator Ricketts, thanks for joining us.\\n    Senator Sullivan, good morning. Welcome.\\n    Senator Sullivan. Ms. Fox, I want to start with a chart \\nhere that I have trotted out a lot in this committee room. This \\nis a chart of life expectancy in America and in Alaska in \\nparticular for the last 25 years, from 1980 to 2014. Do you see \\nwhere the blue and dark blue is? That is life expectancy going \\nup a lot. Actually yellow, orange, red, actually life \\nexpectancy has decreased, that is really sad in America. Mostly \\nthat has been due to the opioid epidemic that has killed so \\nmany Americans.\\n    But my State, particularly in the rural regions, the North \\nSlope, interior, Aleutian Island chain, has had the largest \\nlife expectancy increases of any place in the country in the \\nlast 25 years, up to 13 years in many of our rural areas. So \\nthat is a great indicator of policy success.\\n    Why do you think that happened? That is a hard question. \\nBut 1980 to 2014, what else happened in Alaska during that \\ntime? I will just answer. It is not an easy question.\\n    So we had a very big boom in resource development, oil and \\ngas, mining. So when I get upset about these issues, when \\nFederal agencies try to shut down resource development in my \\nState, it is literally a matter of life and death. The \\ncommunities in rural Alaska that have benefited from that, they \\nare living longer. And I don't know if there is any policy \\nindicator of success more important than are the people you \\nrepresenting living longer.\\n    Would you agree with me?\\n    Ms. Fox. Yes.\\n    Senator Sullivan. Anything more important than that?\\n    Ms. Fox. No.\\n    Senator Sullivan. No, I don't think so, either.\\n    So one of the things that is frustrating, we just went \\nthrough this Willow process, the vast, vast majority of the \\nAlaska Native people were supportive. The national media hated \\nto write that story. They kept canceling the voices of the \\nindigenous people of Alaska. But we finally got it out there.\\n    And one of the big reasons is because of this. They know it \\nis jobs, pride, things that most communities take for granted \\nlike running water, flush toilets. You get infrastructure, you \\nget jobs, you get revenues, you can do those things that, in \\nparts of my State, people haven't had access to for a long \\ntime, maybe ever.\\n    So let me talk about a related area. But it is all in this \\narea, too, it is mining. Unfortunately, the Administration on a \\nnumber of mining projects, the Ambler mining district in \\nparticular, we did a 7 year EIS, $10 million. The same day the \\nPresident held a critical mineral summit at the White House on \\nthe importance of cutting our dependence on foreign critical \\nminerals like from China. They reversed that EIS in Alaska.\\n    Now, that was the Department of Interior, Secretary Haaland \\nseems hell bent on reversing everything, despite that chart. \\nKind of remarkable that she would be doing that. But the EPA \\nrecently finalized this 404(c) action on Pebble, the preemptive \\nveto action, but you said, ``It is also important to note that \\nthe EPA's action does not apply to current or future resource \\ndevelopment projects in Alaska.'' Similarly, Administrator \\nRegan said, ``By no means is this decision meant to send any \\nsignals beyond this specific project.''\\n    Can you begin by recommitting to me that EPA won't use \\n404(c) as a precedent to stop future Alaska projects, or \\nimportantly, anything that has already previously been \\npermitted in Alaska? Keeping this in mind. Because when you do \\nthat, when Deb Haaland recently reversed the Ambler decision, \\nshe actually yesterday reversed the King Cove Road decision, \\nthere is no Native project that people in Alaska care about \\nthat she doesn't reverse, the Native people, by the way, again, \\nstunning to me. But can you recommit to what you and the \\nAdministrator already said with regard to mining projects in my \\nState?\\n    Ms. Fox. Yes, and Senator Sullivan, it is good to see you \\nagain. I was just thinking, seeing your map, the last time we \\nwere together was at the Bethel Airport, this past summer when \\nwe were both visiting an Alaska Native village that was working \\non a water infrastructure project. So it is good to see you \\nagain.\\n    And yes, to be clear, EPA has sparingly used our 404(c) \\nauthority, only three times in the last 30 years, three times. \\nThat is it. And yes, I commit, as does Administrator Regan, \\nthat it will be sparingly used. We were very clear that that \\n404(c) action was about a particular mine and a particular \\ngeography, the geography of Bristol Bay, a beautiful and unique \\necosystem.\\n    Senator Sullivan. OK, thank you, I don't want to interrupt. \\nI just have one final question. I spoke at the annual \\nconference of the Tanana Chiefs Conference yesterday in \\ninterior Alaska. I talked about water and sewer and the needs \\nto get some of the communities, we have 30 communities in \\nAlaska that don't have flush toilets and running water.\\n    By the way, these are some of the most patriotic \\ncommunities in America, because Alaska Natives serve at higher \\nrates in the military than any other ethnic group in the \\ncountry.\\n    So can you recommit to me, given the resources in the \\nInfrastructure Bill, I told them that you are going to be \\nworking with us on getting rid of what we call honey buckets, \\nwhich is a euphemism for people having to go to the bathroom \\nand then take their own waste out and throw it in a lagoon. \\nPretty disgusting. American citizens still do that in my State.\\n    Can you recommit to me to help us get rid of the honey \\nbucket once and for all?\\n    Ms. Fox. Absolutely. Seeing first hand people living with \\nhoney buckets with washeterias when I visited Alaska last \\nAugust, I am absolutely committed to this. And I think we have \\nthe ability to make tremendous progress because of the \\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law and the incredible leadership \\nthat President Biden and this Congress have made in investing \\n$50 billion. So you have my absolute commitment on that.\\n    Senator Sullivan. Great. Thank you.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Carper. Thank you, Senator.\\n    In the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Ms. Fox, Congress \\ncommitted to ensuring that disadvantaged communities benefit \\nfrom Federal drinking water and wastewater infrastructure \\ninvestments. The Biden administration has made the same pledge \\nthrough its Justice 40 initiative.\\n    State policies such as project ranking systems that have \\nadditional eligibility criteria can create barriers to \\ndisadvantaged and underserved communities' ability to access \\nfunds. Here is my question: Is EPA tracking these State level \\nbarriers, and what is the agency's plan to help communities \\novercome these barriers so that they can access Federal \\ninvestment in water infrastructure?\\n    Ms. Fox. Thank you for that question. Yes, Senator, we are \\ntracking those barriers and working actively with individual \\nStates as well as with CIFA, the Council of Infrastructure \\nFinancing Authorities, to collaboratively develop solutions to \\nthose barriers.\\n    The States and EPA, we share a commitment to making sure \\nthat we make these resources available to as many communities \\nas possible. And things like a project ranking system, it is a \\nbarrier in some States. There are other barriers that exist as \\nwell. Some States, for example, have only an annual application \\nprocess, while other States allow for multiple rounds of \\nsubmission of SRFs. That is another thing.\\n    I think there are challenges around local communities \\nknowing when to apply and having full transparency into that \\nprocess. So there are a range of barriers, as there are with \\nmany funding and financing programs across the Federal \\nGovernment. So we are very closely partnering with the States \\nto work through those together.\\n    One thing I can also say is there is an incredible amount \\nof peer exchange and learning that is happening right now \\nacross States. There are trainings and opportunities for the \\nStates to come together to learn from one another. And we want \\nto support and encourage that as much as possible, as well.\\n    Senator Carper. All right, thank you.\\n    One of the Biden administration's priorities has been to \\nreplace lead service lines. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law \\nincluded $15 billion in funding for full lead service line \\nreplacements, a lot of money. In the years leading up to the \\npassage of that law, we heard from several States, including my \\nown State of Delaware, that the prevalence of lead service \\nlines was not a significant problem. However, as some of those \\nStates started doing lead inventories, it became clear that the \\npresence of lead pipes and the health impacts they cause is \\nmore pervasive than a lot of folks expected.\\n    Given this initial skepticism, have the States been able to \\nuse funding for lead service line replacements?\\n    Ms. Fox. One of the most exciting aspects of this job and \\nserving in this capacity is to help deliver on President \\nBiden's commitment to get the lead out once and for all. It is \\njust so remarkable, the President's leadership on this issue. \\nAnd at the EPA, we are using every tool in our tool box to \\ndeliver on that.\\n    As it relates to your question, Senator, the reaction is \\nmixed. There are some States that feel that their allocation of \\nlead service line money is insufficient for the need. Others \\nthink that the allocation is too much, given how much the need \\nis there. So we are in constant conversation with the States to \\nunderstand that.\\n    We do have what is called a reallotment process that we can \\nutilize, so that after 2 years, if a State doesn't use their \\nlead service line money, we can reallocate it to a State that \\ncould use it. So right now, we are in the process of working \\nwith the States to make sure that they know they can use this \\nmoney to support inventory development. Because that is the \\nfirst thing to really understand the nature and scope of the \\nproblem to start those replacement projects. But then yes, \\nafter those 2 years of States utilizing those resources, we \\nwill be able to reallocate.\\n    Senator Carper. Thank you. My last question today deals \\nwith private wells. My family grew up in West Virginia and \\nlargely in Virginia. We always had private wells, and I think a \\nlot of folks around the country still do, and a lot of folks \\nhave private wells drilled for them, for their families and \\nfarms in some cases.\\n    The presence of contaminated private well water is becoming \\na problem nationwide, as you know. In Delaware, we know that \\nare about 173,000 residents depend upon private wells. Most \\npeople think we don't have that many people in Delaware, but we \\ndo. We have a million people now. There are about 173,000 \\nresidents who depend on private wells for their drinking water. \\nThis number is actually growing, not shrinking.\\n    Congress included language in the Drinking Water and \\nWastewater Infrastructure Act to allow EPA to give grants to \\nStates to address underground sources of contamination \\nimpacting wells. Unfortunately, EPA has determined it cannot \\nimplement the language except to connect homeowners to a \\nregulated water utility, which as you know is not always \\nfeasible.\\n    Because wells are managed by the States, Congress does not \\nexpect EPA to take on the regulation of wells under the Safe \\nDrinking Water Act. Having said that, Congress did expect EPA \\nto help States address these sources of contaminated drinking \\nwater.\\n    I am going to ask if you would be willing to commit today \\nto working with this Committee on the Environment and Public \\nWorks to help address well contamination by providing resources \\nto States.\\n    Ms. Fox. I absolutely commit to that. This is a shared \\nconcern around protecting public health, and I am happy to work \\nclosely with this Committee on this issue moving forward.\\n    Senator Carper. All right.\\n    Is there any question you wish you had been asked that you \\nhave not been asked? This is a freebie.\\n    Ms. Fox. My favorite question to ask people is, what is \\nyour favorite body of water.\\n    Senator Carper. All right, now that I am the only one here, \\nwhat would that be?\\n    Ms. Fox. The Pacific Ocean.\\n    Senator Carper. That is great. It is hard to argue with \\nthat one.\\n    That is it for my questions for you today. I want to thank \\nyou again for being here and for your responses, and for the \\nwork that has gone on. Convey to your team our thanks, \\nespecially for the work on chemicals. That is one that is of \\ngreat importance to the Ranking Member and me, and I think to \\nall of us.\\n    I tell this story, and I will close in a moment and move to \\nthe next panel. I spent a lot of my life in Navy airplanes. I \\nliterally witnessed a terrible tragedy at Moffett Field Naval \\nAir Station when I was on active duty, two parallel runways. We \\nshared the base with lots of NASA airplanes. Our P3s were \\nsmaller, four engine airplanes, not as big as the ones NASA \\nflew in.\\n    Early one morning, two planes were coming down to land \\nsimultaneously on the two parallel runways, a Navy P3 on the \\nright and a larger NASA aircraft on the left. Both planes were \\ncleared to land, as it turned out, on the same runway. And the \\nlarger NASA plane crushed the P3 and killed about 18 people. \\nFirefighters rushed out to try to save lives; 18 people died.\\n    About 28 years later, I was living in Delaware heading down \\nRoute 1, heading down to the Rehobeth area, approaching Dover \\nAir Force Base, which is on the left as you head south on Route \\n1. I could see black smoke coming up from the Air Force Base. A \\nC5 cargo plane, which is a huge aircraft, which was fully \\nloaded with gas and fuel and cargo, had tried to take off from \\nDover Air Force Base, climbed up to an altitude, four engines \\non the C5, and they got an engine warning on one of the four \\nengines. The flight engineer shut down the wrong engine. So \\ninstead of having four engines working, they had two. They had \\na full bag of fuel and fully loaded. And they tried to come \\naround and land on the runway, they lost their altitude, they \\ndidn't make it. They went in about a mile south of the approach \\nend of the runway.\\n    Firefighters came out from all over the Dover Air Force \\nBase, covered the plane with foam and saved every life. Saved \\nevery life. That is the good news. The bad news is in the wake \\nof that, we have four communities around Dover Air Force Base \\nwho have contaminated drinking water.\\n    So it is something that was really intended to save lives, \\nit turns out it inhibits the quality of life. We are still \\ndealing with that in Delaware. We are dealing with it in West \\nVirginia. I am very pleased with the attention that the issue \\nhas received and hopefully will continue to receive.\\n    Again, thank you very much.\\n    Senator Capito, anything else you want to say?\\n    Senator Capito. Thank you.\\n    Senator Carper. All right, thank you so much.\\n    With that, we will welcome our second panel.\\n    Thank you, ma'am.\\n    Good morning. I think we have an opportunity to welcome you \\nall individually. We are delighted that you are here. Thank you \\nfor your testimony; thank you for your service as well.\\n    Randy Hayman is Commissioner and CEO of the Philadelphia \\nWater Department, a role he was appointed to in 2019 by Mayor \\nJim Kenney.\\n    We consider you a neighbor right up the road. You tell the \\nMayor we were asking for him, and we give him our best. Thank \\nyou for joining us today.\\n\\n      STATEMENT OF RANDY E. HAYMAN, COMMISSIONER AND CEO, \\n                 PHILADELPHIA WATER DEPARTMENT\\n\\n    Mr. Hayman. Thank you, Chairman Carper, and Ranking Member \\nCapito, and members of the Committee. Thank you for the \\nopportunity to testify on the critical new resources and \\nassistance being delivered by the Infrastructure Investment and \\nJobs Act and the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure \\nAct, commonly known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, or \\nBIL.\\n    As the Commissioner and CEO of the Philadelphia Water \\nDepartment and as a member of the Board of Directors of the \\nAssociation of Metropolitan Water Agencies, I know that the \\nnation is long overdue for landmark investment in water \\ninfrastructure. So I want to begin my testimony by commending \\nthis Committee for its leadership in developing the Drinking \\nWater and Wastewater components of the BIL, and the \\ncooperative, open door engagement with the AMWA and other water \\nsector stakeholders that was the hallmark of this process.\\n    This bill was the model of how both parties and sector \\nstakeholders can work together to find common ground. This is \\nwhy the initial DWWIA, the Drinking Water and Wastewater \\nInfrastructure Act, which passed the Senate with a vote of 89 \\nto 2 before being incorporated into the larger bill.\\n    But this is all about how we got here. Today I want to \\nfocus my comments on the on the ground benefits that resources \\nprovided by the Infrastructure Law are providing to my \\ncommunity. For background, in 2019, Philadelphia completed its \\nwater revitalization plan, a 25 year, multi-billion dollar \\nstrategic vision for upgrading our city drinking water \\ninfrastructure. The plan contains an estimated 400 necessary \\nprojects, including rebuilding water retreatment plants and \\nreplacing pumping stations and transmission mains, while \\nleveraging low cost financing opportunities to keep rates \\naffordable for our customers.\\n    To be honest, the financing component represents one of the \\nhardest aspects of the plan. We know what to do. We know what \\nwork we need to do to strengthen our city's water \\ninfrastructure. Our engineers are smart, and they are \\ndedicated.\\n    What is not as apparent is how the city can pay for it \\nwithout raising our water and sewer rates to unsustainable \\nlevels. Fortunately, passage of the DWWIA came at an opportune \\ntime, because our city was working to implement this plan. And \\nlast month, President Biden announced that Philadelphia will \\nreceive $500 million in financing through several different \\nprograms authorized and funded by----\\n    Senator Carper. Could you say that again? How much was \\nthat?\\n    Mr. Hayman. Five hundred million, a significant amount.\\n    This includes $160 million through Pennsylvania's share of \\nthe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds to upgrade treatment \\nfacilities and replace more than 19 miles of water mains and \\nany lead service lines discovered during this work.\\n    Additionally, in January, Philadelphia closed on a $19.8 \\nmillion loan from EPA's WIFIA program. This will support the \\nreplacement of 15 miles of water mains and approximately 160 \\nlead service lines throughout the city at lower financing costs \\nthan we otherwise would have faced. This loan represents just \\nthe first stage of a $340 million worth of WIFIA assistance \\npromised to Philadelphia by EPA. These future investments will \\nbe paid for by subsequent rounds of WIFIA loans.\\n    So this is why it is so essential that Congress reauthorize \\nWIFIA as part of the DWWIA and set a course for the program \\nstability in years to come. While WIFIA has become consistently \\nfunded by Congress, DWWIA extended multiple other water and \\nwastewater infrastructure funding programs, many of which are \\nstill awaiting meaningful investments and appropriations by \\nCongress, implementation by EPA.\\n    One such program is EPA's Midsize and Large Drinking Water \\nSystem Infrastructure Resilience and Sustainability Program, \\nwhich will help drinking water systems prepare to withstand the \\neffects of natural disasters and cybersecurity threats. AMWA \\nchampioned creation of this program, alongside Senator Ben \\nCardin, and we are pleased to see it received an initial $5 \\nmillion appropriation in the final fiscal year 2023 spending \\nlegislation.\\n    However, the national need is much greater than $5 million. \\nThe water systems across the country are still waiting for EPA \\nto stand up the program. AMWA urges EPA to move with diligence \\nto make this program operational and to request full funding in \\nfuture budget requests.\\n    Finally, let me conclude. There are a few areas that I \\nthink the funding and progress provided by DWWIA could be made \\neven more effective. First, we greatly appreciate the law \\nauthorized a new low income water wastewater system pilot \\nprogram at EPA. Water affordability is a national need, and it \\nshould be part of the Federal safety net. AMWA urges EPA to \\nquickly complete its required National Water Affordability \\nNeeds Assessment, so that the pilot program can be funded and \\nput to work.\\n    We would also appreciate more clarity and consistency in \\nrelation to which communities are eligible to receive \\nadditional subsidized SRF funding provided by the bill. EPA has \\nspecified that this is available to disadvantaged communities.\\n    But due to several factors, Philadelphia Water cannot \\nassess grants of principal forgiveness through the PENNVEST \\nState Revolving Fund, most prominently due to the affordability \\nmethodology used. This means that the loans currently being \\nprovided through the Bill funding will have to be repaid \\nthrough higher water bills in Philadelphia and other \\ncommunities facing similar hurdles.\\n    AMWA would be interested in working to establish clear and \\nconsistent baseline standards to ensure low income populations \\ncan benefit from this aid, no matter what size community they \\nare in.\\n    Again, I thank you for the opportunity to testify before \\nyou today. AMWA was honored to work with the Committee on \\ndevelopment of the infrastructure legislation, and the \\nPhiladelphia Water department is proud to be among its first \\nrecipients.\\n    I have submitted my full statement for the record, and I am \\nhappy to answer any questions you may have.\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Hayman follows:]\\n    \\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n    \\n    Senator Carper.

It can be, for several things. Either \\nNortheast Wisconsin or New in that we take wastewater and \\nprovide a new product, which are resource recovery and clean \\nwater.\\n    Senator Carper. All right, good. Executive Director of \\nRegional Clean Water Utility in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\\n    One of the most exciting exhibition football games I ever \\nsaw was in Green Bay. You would have thought they were playing \\nfor the Super Bowl. It was in August. They were so pumped.\\n    Senator Capito. Is that the one you played in?\\n    Senator Carper. It is the one I should have played in.\\n    [Laughter.]\\n    Senator Carper. I don't think so.\\n    Mr. Sigmund, you are recognized to give your statement. \\nThanks a lot for joining us and for what you do. Take it away.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF THOMAS W. SIGMUND, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION \\n   OF CLEAN WATER AGENCIES, AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NEW WATER\\n\\n    Mr. Sigmund. Chairman Carper, Ranking Member Capito, and \\nmembers of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to \\nappear at today's hearing.\\n    My name is Tom Sigmund. I serve as President of the Board \\nof Directors of the National Association of Clean Water \\nAgencies, and I am also Executive Director at NEW Water, the \\nbrand of the Green Bay Metropolitan Sewerage District, in Green \\nBay, Wisconsin, where I have been since 2007.\\n    NEW Water is a regional clean water utility providing \\nwholesale conveyance and treatment services to 238,000 people \\nacross 15 municipalities in northeast Wisconsin. We have 101 \\nemployees, an annual budget of $49 million, and maintain a 20 \\nyear capital improvement plan of $470 million in 2021 dollars. \\nOur utility views the material sent to its facilities as a \\nvaluable resource to be recovered and reused, and we are \\ncommitted to continued improvement in the watershed.\\n    For over 50 years, NACWA has represented public wastewater \\nand stormwater agencies nationwide that are on the front lines \\nof public health and environmental protection. Our unique and \\ngrowing network of 350 public agency members works to ensure \\npublic utilities have the tools necessary to provide affordable \\nand sustainable clean water for all.\\n    As part of that mission, NACWA has long advocated for the \\nFederal Government to recommit to a full and reliable \\npartnership with local communities to invest in and build \\ncritical water infrastructure.\\n    In this country, local customers and ratepayers have paid \\nfor the overwhelming majority of investment in water and sewer \\ninfrastructure. Not surprisingly, the costs of providing clean \\nand safe water have been growing for years, and by extension, \\nrates have been also increasing to meet this cost. This can be \\na significant hardship for many in our communities. And those \\nof us responsible for setting or influencing rates take this \\nvery seriously.\\n    The historic water infrastructure investments in DWWIA and \\nIIJA, which is commonly referred to as the Bipartisan \\nInfrastructure Law, or BIL, can offer much needed help to local \\ngovernments working to juggle these dynamics. NACWA has engaged \\nwith EPA on implementation, and we are encouraged by the \\nefforts of Administrator Regan and Assistant Administrator Fox \\non this major undertaking to implement the statute \\nexpeditiously and ensure it achieves the goals set forth by \\nCongress.\\n    My full written comments, along with a recent funding \\nreport NACWA has released last July, have been provided to you, \\nso I will try to keep my remarks brief.\\n    I first want to discuss the importance of the Clean Water \\nState Revolving Fund, commonly known as CWSRF. NACWA applauds \\nthe bipartisan commitment DWWIA has made to the CWSRF through \\nboth direct appropriations and increases to authorized annual \\nfunding. These funds are invaluable to POTWs. Nearly all of the \\nfiscal year 2022 CWSRF general capitalization grants have gone \\nout to the States, and EPA recently announced the fiscal year \\n2023 supplemental funding that each State's CWSRF should expect \\nto receive due to BIL.\\n    However, in fiscal years 2022 and 2023, Congress has not \\nappropriated at the full levels authorized in BIL, only 60 \\npercent in fiscal year 2023, which reduces the overall impact \\nCongress sought to make with this investment package. NACWA is \\ndiscouraged by the request within President Biden's recently \\nreleased budget for fiscal year 2024, calling for a level \\nfunding of the CWSRF with last fiscal year, rather than the \\nincrease that Congress authorized in BIL, which would be $3 \\nbillion for next year. NACWA continues to urge full funding for \\nthe CWSRF in each fiscal year.\\n    The next issue is PFAS. Utilities are extremely concerned \\nabout the potential health and environmental risks associated \\nwith exposure to PFAS and what it may mean for the future of \\npublic clean water utility operations. An important provision \\nin BIL was the allocation of funds for emerging contaminants, \\nincluding PFAS, through the CWSRF. POTWs are concerned about \\nthe looming costs that they may face to manage or dispose of \\nthese contaminants, which water utilities passively receive and \\ndid not create or profit from.\\n    As a new pot of funding, these BIL resources are \\npredictably seeing a slower approval rate than traditional SRF \\nfunding. To my knowledge, approximately half of the States have \\nreceived these fiscal year 2022 awards to date.\\n    One obstacle to getting these funding plans approved and \\nfunds distributed quickly is that many of the most immediate \\ncosts utilities face including monitoring, assessing, and \\nimplementing pre-treatment programs. However, these important \\nsteps are not clearly eligible under the SRF, which focuses on \\ncapital investments. State SRFs have the authority to request \\nfull transfer of CWSRF funds designated for emerging \\ncontaminants to be applied to accounts for drinking water. For \\nthis fiscal year, several States have opted to pursue this \\ntransfer, Wisconsin included.\\n    This option allows States the flexibility to prioritize \\ntheir most immediate emerging contaminant needs. But this \\nshould not suggest that clean water utilities will not also \\nface significant costs to help control and remediate PFAS in \\ntheir communities.\\n    NACWA is working with EPA and utilities to identify \\npotential near term uses that are allowed under the CWSRF. \\nHowever, congressional clarity or a distinct pot of funding \\nfocused on helping communities assess PFAS sources entering \\ntheir wastewater streams may be needed.\\n    Another issue we have is how to support customers and \\nratepayers in need of low income water assistance and address \\naffordability challenges. BIL directed EPA to conduct a \\nnational low income water needs assessment, which has since \\nbeen appropriated funding. This needs assessment will help \\nCongress and the public understand the full scope of national \\nhardship in paying water and sewer bills. However, it may not \\nbe complete for several years. In the meantime, households \\ncontinue to struggle.\\n    To help address this challenge, NACWA strongly supports a \\npermanent, reliable source of Federal assistance with full \\nfunding to ensure households can afford their water and sewer \\nbills and utilities have the resources they need to make \\ncritical investments.\\n    Finally, NACWA and I appreciate the opportunity to share \\nour views on the implementation of DWWIA and IIJA. I am proud \\nof the work that the public wastewater sector has accomplished \\nto date to advance public health and environmental protection. \\nOur nation's understanding of the complexity of water quality \\nchallenges only continues to grow.\\n    I hope that my testimony shows how these investment \\npackages are providing initial investments in making our \\nwastewater infrastructure safer and more resilient and \\nresponsive to new threats like emerging contaminants, while \\nemphasizing the vast need for funding and how we hope this \\ninvestment is only a start.\\n    We sincerely hope this increased Federal cost share for \\nwater will become the groundwork for greater Federal investment \\nto meet our growing water challenges in the years ahead. \\nContinued resources and assistance from the Federal Government \\nare critical to ensure that all water and wastewater utilities \\nare prepared to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow, \\nstarting with full funding of the Bipartisan Infrastructure \\nLaw.\\n    I am happy to answer any questions you might have.\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Sigmund follows:]\\n    \\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n    \\n    Senator Capito [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Sigmund. We \\nappreciate your testimony.\\n    We will now turn to Ms. Kathy Emery. Kathy is the Director \\nof the Division of Water and Waste Management at the West \\nVirginia Department of Environmental Protection.\\n    Welcome to you; we are glad that you are here, from my home \\nState of West Virginia. I understand the legislature just put \\nanother responsibility onto you as well. So thank you for \\ntaking that on, whether you wanted it or not.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF KATHERYN D. EMERY, DIRECTOR, DIVISION OF WATER AND \\n  WASTE MANAGEMENT, WEST VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL \\n                           PROTECTION\\n\\n    Ms. Emery. Thank you.\\n    Good morning and thank you, Chairman Carper, Ranking Member \\nCapito, and all members of the Committee, for the opportunity \\nto testify before you on the Drinking Water and Wastewater \\nInfrastructure Act, which is included in the Infrastructure \\nInvestment and Jobs Act.\\n    My name is Katheryn Emery, and I am the Director of the \\nWest Virginia Department of Environmental Protection's Division \\nof Water and Waste Management. I have either worked in or \\nmanaged West Virginia's Clean Water State Revolving Fund for \\nthe past 28 years.\\n    I am truly honored to represent West Virginia today to \\ndiscuss with you the funding opportunities provided in the \\nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, as well as current \\nwater infrastructure challenges and ongoing unmet needs in \\nsmall, rural, and disadvantaged communities.\\n    Considering that only 50 of West Virginia's combined 671 \\ndrinking water and wastewater utilities serve a population of \\ngreater than 10,000, I think it is safe to say that West \\nVirginia is on the front lines of facing the challenges of \\nmeeting the needs of small, rural, and disadvantaged \\ncommunities. The difficulties to providing services to these \\ncommunities is very real. The reality of small numbers of \\ncustomers, topographical challenges, and low incomes make it \\nvery difficult to find an affordable solution to meet the needs \\nof residents.\\n    Even with 100 percent principal forgiveness and grant \\nfunding, customers fund the rates to support only the operation \\nand maintenance expenses a challenge. In addition, our \\ncommunities are also struggling to find and pay qualified \\noperators.\\n    Infrastructure needs cover providing safe drinking water \\nand treated wastewater to unserved communities, upgrading old \\nand failing infrastructure, locating and addressing lead \\nservice lines, and preparing to meet upcoming PFAS standards as \\nwell as any other new regulatory initiatives.\\n    The supplemental funding from the Act means a lot to our \\ncommunities that are trying to address these challenges. For \\nexample, the number of applicants for a project priority list \\njumped from 101 to 175 in the Clean Water SRF, and from 29 to \\n157 in the Drinking Water SRF, as our communities are preparing \\nto take full advantage of this historic opportunity.\\n    West Virginia has been utilizing multiple approaches to \\naddress these issues. Co-funding and collaboration with other \\nfunding agencies and providing technical assistance are some of \\nthe tools that we are using to fully utilize all available \\nState and Federal dollars to provide safe drinking water and \\ntreated wastewater to as many citizens as possible.\\n    With that being said, I ask for your consideration of a few \\nsuggestions to help us be even more effective in funding \\nprojects to meet the intent of the Act. The most effective part \\nof the SRF programs is the flexibility to tailor the programs \\nto meet individual State needs. States must have the ability to \\ndetermine their own definition of disadvantage, and develop \\ntheir own priority criteria to best meet the needs of the \\ncitizens of their States.\\n    Each of the changes and new initiatives crafted within the \\nAct also need to maintain that flexibility. As you can see from \\nmy written testimony, there are several suggestions for \\nadditional flexibility that, if provided, can help States \\nmaximize the utilization of this funding to fit their \\nindividual situations.\\n    It has been my experience that when working with small \\nutilities and communities without access to adequate water and \\nwastewater infrastructure, situations and needs arise that have \\nnever really been contemplated. That is why it is so critical \\nthat we be very cautious about writing policies and guidance \\ndocuments that limit the abilities of the SRFs and other \\nfunding agencies to adapt to changing needs.\\n    The one size fits all approach doesn't work when trying to \\napply solutions that work for large, existing utilities to \\ncommunities trying to either improve or provide service to, at \\nmost, hundreds of customers.\\n    Thank you again for allowing me the opportunity to discuss \\nthese issues with you today. The problem is always finding a \\nsustainable and affordable solution to communities with small \\nnumbers of customers, and the funding provided through this Act \\nwill help us to address this problem with many disadvantaged \\nand unserved areas.\\n    Thank you.\\n    [The prepared statement of Ms. Emery follows:]\\n    \\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n    Senator Capito. Thank you, Ms. Emery, and thank all three \\nof you.\\n    The reason it looks kind of blank up here is that we are in \\nthe middle of a vote. Chairman Carper went to make his vote, so \\nI will take the time to do my questioning, then I will have to \\nleave and do my constitutional duty.\\n    Ms. Emery, let's get to the flexibility issue. You heard me \\nask Assistant Administrator Fox about this. There was a January \\n6th memo that EPA put out, a guidance memo, that encouraged and \\nsort of sought to impose some of EPA's priorities through, in \\nselecting community investments. This is what I was trying to \\nsay to her, is exactly what you said much better in your \\nstatement: Leave us the flexibility to do what we want and what \\nwe know is best for our communities as we tailor them.\\n    What kind of challenges and concerns do you have that this \\nEPA guidance may be trying to rein in some of your flexibility?\\n    Ms. Emery. I am a little concerned by that memo. It was a \\nbit of a surprise. I do want to start off by saying that this \\npast year, we had a lot of conversations with EPA Region III. \\nThey are an excellent funding partner with West Virginia. They \\nwere asking questions about how we evaluated our affordability \\ncriteria, the prioritization criteria. EPA's guidance had a lot \\nof suggestions for States to consider, and we did take \\nadvantage of those suggestions, and we did make adjustments in \\nour intended use plan.\\n    But when I am reading this memo, and it is talking about \\nadditional criteria, in addition to the intended use plan \\nchecklist, when it is talking about implementation of a \\npriority criteria that they are developing in coming months, \\nthat they are going to be accessing our IUPs based against \\nthat.\\n    Senator Capito. So you haven't even seen that yet?\\n    Ms. Emery. I have not seen it. It is saying it is in \\ndevelopment. So it has me a little concerned that there is \\ngoing to be criteria that they are going to ask us to \\nincorporate into our intended uses.\\n    Senator Capito. So you could create your own plan, tailor \\nit to your own, as Congress intended, tailor it to our State of \\nWest Virginia and to our small, disadvantaged communities and \\nsmaller communities, because that is basically what we are in a \\nlot of ways, very small communities, you formulate all this, \\nyou get your technical expertise together, you formulate the \\nplan, it goes to EPA, and then all of a sudden they come back \\nwith criteria you haven't seen to say, but you are not doing \\nthis and this.\\n    Is that the concern? Am I hearing that correctly?\\n    Ms. Emery. That is my concern. I am wondering where this \\nmemo is taking us at this point.\\n    Senator Capito. Did they give you a timeframe on that?\\n    Ms. Emery. No. I do have a list of questions, it is in the \\nmemo, we are set up to have a conversation with Region III. But \\nlike I said, I have not seen whatever this priority criteria is \\nthat they're supposed to establish.\\n    Senator Capito. Mr. Sigmund, are you hearing this across \\nthe country, same issue?\\n    Mr. Sigmund. I am not familiar with the most recent. Our \\nexperience with the State of Wisconsin Clean Water Fund has \\nbeen very positive, and that has been over the last year. They \\nhave taken what they received from EPA. We have formed a \\nworking group with our Clean Water Fund. They have expanded the \\ndefinition of what is considered to be a disadvantaged \\ncommunity, but have not excluded those that are historical.\\n    So I am not as familiar with the most recent changes.\\n    Senator Capito. Ok. Thank you.\\n    Ms. Emery, I think you and I can talk about it. I thought \\nit was interesting that Senator Lummis talked about leakage of \\nwater out of small systems. We know that is a huge issue for \\nus. We have some lead, we know that was discovered in the north \\ncentral part of the State, and is probably more predominant in \\nother areas of the State.\\n    What do you think our biggest challenge is, specific to our \\nState, in water infrastructure for these small and rural? Is it \\ngoing to be the testing for PFAS as we see it come through the \\ndestruction of PFAS, what are we going to do with it when we \\nget it? How are we going to replace our filters? I am naming \\nsome of the things, if you could, from your perspective.\\n    Ms. Emery. I think the primary thing is affordability and \\nsustainability for our communities.\\n    Senator Capito. For the systems or the individuals, or \\nboth?\\n    Ms. Emery. Yes, all of the above.\\n    Senator Capito. OK.\\n    Ms. Emery. In addition to just what we were talking about, \\nin maintaining existing infrastructure, extending sewer \\nservices out to other communities, other areas. Now we are \\ntrying to assess the PFAS situation in West Virginia, where is \\nit, where is the contamination coming from. And we are adding \\nlead service lines on top of all of that.\\n    So it is a lot for all of these communities to take on. And \\nwe are working with them on these one by one. That is why the \\nflexibility of the SRFs I think has to be maintained. Our \\ncommunities, some of the more rural, disadvantaged, trying to \\ngather enough grant funding and debt forgiveness to support \\njust the projects that they have, because they can't sustain \\ndebt service. They are struggling just to pay their operation \\nand maintenance.\\n    Senator Capito. Right. The customers can't afford another \\nrate hike. I know that is always part of the consideration.\\n    Ms. Emery. An example for that is the community of Iaeger \\nin McDowell County. It is one of our most economically \\ndistressed counties. We are finally getting a sewer system into \\nIaeger. It is a combination of a lot of grant funding sources.\\n    But I was looking at the combined water and wastewater rate \\nfor those citizens. It will be over $100 a month. It will be \\nover 3 percent of the median household income, just for water \\nand wastewater. That is without adding on other considerations \\ngoing forward.\\n    Senator Capito. Thank you. I am going to run and do my \\nvote, and I think Senator Ricketts is going to take the gavel.\\n    Thank you.\\n    Senator Ricketts [presiding]. Thank you very much.\\n    Since Senator Kelly just got here, I am going to go ahead \\nand ask my questions, if that is OK. We just had a Republican \\ngo.\\n    If you want to go, I can let you go first.\\n    Senator Kelly. I am ready, if you are OK with that, \\nSenator.\\n    Senator Ricketts. Then I will let you go.\\n    Senator Kelly. All right.\\n    Good morning, everybody, thank you for being here.\\n    Mr. Hayman and Mr. Sigmund, in the last Congress I worked \\nwith Senator Risch to introduce the Water Infrastructure \\nModernization Act, which would provide dedicated EPA funding \\nfor smart water and wastewater technologies, like pipeline leak \\ndetection systems and sensors and smart water meters. We are \\nhoping to reintroduce this legislation again and see progress \\nmade on the legislation during this Congress.\\n    For both of you, can you speak to how your systems use \\nsmart water technologies to reduce water loss and improve \\nsystem efficiencies, and how would additional Federal resources \\nsuch as through the Water Infrastructure Modernization Act help \\nwater and wastewater systems further deploy these technologies?\\n    Mr. Hayman. I will gladly take that question, Senator. It \\nis important that as a water utility that we keep evolving. And \\none of the main things we have to do is use technology to our \\nadvantage, and do it in a way that is economically feasible. \\nAffordability is a big issue. But when we are able to use \\ntechnology in the big picture to develop a system that is \\nresponsible to our customers, we are doing what is the right \\nthing to do.\\n    As far as smart technology, we have AMI, the Automated \\nMeter Infrastructure program, where we are able to get real \\ntime information about water usage. So you go to the app, go to \\nthe website, and look and see, what is my bill. What happens in \\nthat situation, instead of having a running pipe, let's say a \\nbroken toilet that you are not aware of in the basement, and \\nyour bill is going up, you will be able to go to the site, and \\nyou will see what your bill is. That information truly is power \\nand allows you to be more economically sensible in how you are \\nhandling your household economics.\\n    The bottom line, too, is we also have systems that allow us \\nto hear leaks in pipes. We had a situation where there was a \\nleakage, we couldn't find it. We used the technology, we are \\nworking still to pinpoint it, but we are a lot closer than we \\nwere before.\\n    So the use of technology is important. And the funding is \\nimperative, because all the things we want to do cost. We are \\ndealing with a situation where rates are getting higher and \\nhigher, coming to a level of not being sustainable for many in \\nour communities.\\n    So any moneys we are able to receive to allow us to assist \\nthe customer and to allow us to keep our rates low or not to \\nincrease at all, is beneficial to the entire community.\\n    Senator Kelly. Do you have any examples of percentage wise, \\nor gallons or acre feet of water that a specific investment has \\nresulted in? Any anecdotal example.\\n    Mr. Hayman. I would have to go back and supplement the \\nrecord after the hearing on that. But I must say that the AMI \\nprocess, of being able to have real time information, is truly \\nimportant, and it is revolutionary in Philadelphia. Because \\nwhat is happening is that people can monitor the water usage, \\nthey can monitor if there is a leak in a pipe. It is a $100 \\nmillion project. But it is going to be greatly beneficial for \\ndecades to come.\\n    Senator Kelly. Mr. Sigmund.\\n    Mr. Sigmund. Coming from a clean water utility, water loss \\nis not a concern for us. But in the implementation of smart \\ntechnology, in our interceptor systems, we do use some of the \\nsmart meter covers to be able to identify, during periods of \\nwet weather events, high flows that we might either reroute \\nflows if that is possible. Because oftentimes rainfall is not \\nuniform across the service area. Or to be able to deploy forces \\nto potentially mitigate some of the problems with high flows.\\n    Within our treatment facilities, we are a huge energy user. \\nSo we have used smart technologies to be able to analyze how we \\nuse energy and possibly tie it to some of our aeration \\nequipment to maybe slow down some of the aeration equipment \\nwhen it is not needed to run at quite the full capacity.\\n    The ability to mine this tremendous amount of information \\nthat we collect, we collect tons of information, and our staff \\ncan only manage so much, we have gone to technologies to be \\nable to predict where we would go, which helps our operators \\nmake better decisions.\\n    So the smart technology in wastewater and utilities is \\nbeing used, and it is being beneficial, and I mentioned with \\nstaffing, as we are struggling to continue to find treatment \\noperators, maintenance and electrician technicians, that smart \\ntechnology is allowing us to stretch those forces a little \\nfarther.\\n    Senator Kelly. Thank you, and thank you, Senator Ricketts. \\nI yield time that I don't have. I yield back nothing.\\n    [Laughter.]\\n    Senator Carper [presiding]. Thank you.\\n    All right, Senator Ricketts, you are in it for the second \\nround, I think.\\n    Senator Ricketts. Thank you, Chairman. Actually, this is \\nthe first time with this panel.\\n    We had Administrator Fox here earlier talking about PFAS. \\nSo I am going to give you all a question, for the entire panel, \\nwhat types of tools would be helpful in addressing the impacts \\nto water infrastructure that especially I am concerned \\nparticularly about rural communities, when it comes to PFAS? \\nWhat are some of the tools you have seen that are going to be \\nhelpful as we go through this rulemaking to be able to make \\nsure communities can apply?\\n    Do you want to start, Mr. Hayman?\\n    Mr. Hayman. With PFAS, I think a couple of things. One, it \\nis important that we understand what are we looking at, that we \\nunderstand what the numbers are. We are going to be receiving a \\nlot of new data on PFAS, so it is important that we work \\nclosely with the scientists and engineers to see, what does \\nthat really mean.\\n    The other part of it is that anything that we do with PFAS, \\nit is going to be an additional cost. It is going to be an \\nadditional burden to the ratepayer. So it is imperative that we \\nreceive some funding to assist us in making sure that we are \\nnot putting upon the ratepayer a burden that they can't carry, \\nor additional bills that they would have to cover.\\n    Basically, though, I would say that we are going to have to \\nwork with our engineers to evaluate it, to make sure we have \\nthe machinery to do it. I have to say this: I am very proud of \\nPhiladelphia. We are often on the cutting edge, and on this \\nissue, we are on the cutting edge of evaluating PFAS. We have \\nbeen doing that voluntarily for over a year. We have been \\nputting the information that we find on our website.\\n    Also, we have been transparent. I think too that is going \\nto be a major part of being successful as a water utility in \\nthis country, that we cannot go back to how we operated in the \\n1950s, 1960s. There is a need to be transparent. We have done \\nthat as far as releasing information and keeping the public \\ninformed.\\n    We have to make sure we have the machinery we need and \\nequipment we need to analyze it. We have to understand what we \\nare looking at, and we have to be transparent as far as \\nreleasing information and educating the public on what we have.\\n    Senator Ricketts. Do you have any idea of how much, just \\nballpark, what it is going to cost to be able to do that?\\n    Mr. Hayman. I don't know. In all honesty, the law just \\nchanged, the requirements changed yesterday. It is now four \\nparts per trillion; before it was, in Philadelphia, I think it \\nwas about 14 parts per trillion. So we are going to have to \\nevaluate it and make decisions as we go forward.\\n    Senator Ricketts. Thank you.\\n    Mr. Sigmund.\\n    Mr. Sigmund. We are just in the process of starting an \\nevaluation, data collection and evaluation process for PFAS in \\nour system. We are expecting to spend between our utility and \\nworking with our significant industrial dischargers who we \\nbelieve might discharge PFAS probably in the vicinity of \\n$100,000 to $200,000 a year for the testing and the analysis.\\n    So that is going to be a first step for us to try to \\nunderstand where this is coming from. That testing process is \\nnot easy. The analysis process is not inexpensive. So that is a \\nbig part of it.\\n    One thing I wanted to mention, probably the biggest concern \\nfor myself as a utility, is CERCLA in terms of PFAS. As the \\nrule is currently written, wastewater utilities, even though \\nthe EPA says they do not play to call us as a principal \\nresponsible party, my utility experience with PCBs over about \\ntwo decades was that we spent in excess of a million dollars to \\nboth, through legal fees as well as being considered to be a de \\nminimis party.\\n    So yes, EPA says, we are not going to consider you to be a \\nprincipal responsible party, but that doesn't mean that the \\nprincipal responsible parties won't come after us for \\ncontribution. That is, I think, going to be one of the biggest \\nconcerns for utilities, is being brought into that entire \\nprocess. That is why we hope that Congress will grant an \\nexemption to clean water utilities.\\n    Senator Ricketts. Thank you, Mr. Sigmund.\\n    Ms. Emery.\\n    Ms. Emery. I do share some of Mr. Sigmund's concerns on the \\npart of the utilities. In West Virginia, we have spent the last \\ncouple years of doing an assessment of all our drinking water \\nsources in the State, just to try to determine where this is \\nlocated, at least starting with the drinking water utilities. \\nWe are doing further analysis, further testing, finished water, \\ntrying to find out the source of contamination.\\n    That being said, we are trying to be very strategic on how \\nwe address this, where it is located, where it is coming from. \\nSo one of the suggestions we would have is allowing more \\nmonitoring to be used out of this emerging contaminants \\nfunding. It does say that we can use monitoring, but it has to \\nbe specifically tied to an upcoming project. But our POTWs are \\nworried about the expense of monitoring on themselves.\\n    So the flexibility to use this funding to do just \\nmonitoring and studies, just to figure out the realm of the \\nproblem we have, would be very beneficial.\\n    Senator Ricketts. Great. Thank you.\\n    Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Carper. Senator Ricketts, that is it for you, my \\nfriend.\\n    I am going to ask a couple of questions, and that might be \\nit. Thanks for being here twice for two rounds. That is good, \\nthank you.\\n    I have three questions; we have three panelists. I am going \\nto ask each of you a question.\\n    We will start, Mr. Hayman, with you again. The Bipartisan \\nInfrastructure Law, which I think I can speak for my colleagues \\nand I here, is one of the things we are proudest of that we \\nhave worked on in our lives. It was a great bipartisan triumph \\nwith the leadership of the President and Democrats and \\nRepublicans.\\n    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided I think more \\nthan $11 billion to the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan \\nFund over 5 years. The law dictates that some 49 percent of \\neach State's annual funding allocation ``shall be used by the \\nState to provide grants, forgiveness of principal, or a \\ncombination of both.''\\n    Whether a project is eligible for a grant from the SRF as \\nopposed to a loan is determined by each State's own rules on \\nthis subject. Some of the State determined affordability \\ncriteria, however, prevent large cities like Philadelphia from \\nbeing able to receive grants for loan forgiveness for water \\ninfrastructure projects that would benefit low income, \\ndisadvantaged, and minority communities living with a larger \\nmetropolitan area.\\n    Here's my question. Has Philadelphia had trouble accessing \\nthe grant funding provided for in the Bipartisan Infrastructure \\nLaw? And what kinds of projects do you think these grant funds \\ncould support if the affordability criteria was changed?\\n    Mr. Hayman. Thank you, Senator. Thank you very much for the \\nquestion.\\n    The bottom line is yes, we are having difficulty in \\nreceiving grants from the PENNVEST State Revolving Fund, \\nprimarily because of the way that they determine economic \\nfeasibility or accountability. Basically what they are saying \\nis that our rates are too low. And what is happening is they \\nare looking at what people are able to pay across the entire \\nboard. While there might be one area that is richer than \\nanother, that skews the numbers. And as a result, despite the \\nsize of Philadelphia, despite being one of the largest, poorest \\ncities in the country, we are in a situation where we are not \\nable to obtain the grants.\\n    As a result, we receive loans, and those loans then put a \\nburden on the customer, because those loans have to be repaid.\\n    Now, let me also answer your second part, if I may. You \\nstated that there is, what projects could we do. There are a \\nplethora of projects that we have. As I said earlier, our \\nengineers are smart, and we have tons of projects that we could \\nwork on. One of them is our Water Revitalization Program. It is \\ngoing to turn around and have 400 projects that allow us to \\nrebuild our water plants, our transmission mains, and make sure \\nwe have the tunnels that we need to transport redundancy and \\ntransport the water across from different water utility parts.\\n    So in the end, there are pipes that can be replaced or \\nthere are plants that can be repaired, there are a number of \\nprojects we would use the moneys for. And again, grants are \\nbetter than the loans, because they do not place an economic \\nresponsibility on the customer down the road. They don't have \\nto be repaid.\\n    Senator Carper. Good. Thank you.\\n    My second question, Mr. Sigmund, according to a report by \\nthe National Association of Clean Water Agencies and the \\nAssociation of Metropolitan Water Agencies, it is estimated \\nthat drinking water and wastewater utilities will need an \\nadditional $448 billion to $944 billion between now and 2050 to \\nmake their systems more resilient to extreme weather events. \\nThe Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act created \\nseveral new grant programs focused on providing resources to \\ndrinking water and wastewater utilities who wish to improve \\ntheir systems' resiliency to extreme weather events and other \\nthreats.\\n    While I was glad to see those programs receiving funding \\nlast year, the appropriated amount was well below the \\nauthorized level. Here is my question. Do you think it is \\nimportant for Congress to fully fund the resiliency program \\ncreated in the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure \\nAct, and how would those programs be used to address specific \\nproblems caused by climate change?\\n    Mr. Sigmund. I would answer yes, it is very important for \\nCongress to fully fund these programs. What NACWA has provided \\nto you is not an exaggeration. It is where we see the state of \\nour infrastructure; we are a very heavy capital infrastructure. \\nWe make it last a long time, but it doesn't last forever and \\nneeds to be replaced.\\n    The resiliency from climate change, in my utility we have \\nseen our system be stressed three times in the last 5 years at \\nits maximum capacity. We are able to deliver service because we \\nhad all of our equipment able to be in service, which is not \\nalways the case, because of maintenance.\\n    So we are seeing in our State of Wisconsin and our area not \\nnecessarily more rainfall throughout the year, maybe a little \\nbit more, but it is coming at different times and with greater \\nintensity. And our infrastructure needs to be upgraded to be \\nable to handle these peak flows.\\n    Senator Carper. Thank you.\\n    I have one more question for Ms. Emery.\\n    We have been joined by Senator Markey, and I am going to \\nyield to him for any questions he might have.\\n    Senator Markey, welcome, good afternoon.\\n    Senator Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Carper. Have you voted twice?\\n    Senator Markey. I have voted, yes. Have you voted?\\n    Senator Carper. Just once.\\n    Senator Markey. Thank you all so much. In 2021, a malicious \\nactor hacked into a water treatment facility in Florida and \\nincreased the level of lye, an ingredient used in soap and \\nfertilizer in the water, by over 11,000 percent. Fortunately, \\nan operator noticed the intrusion. That attack was a wakeup \\ncall.\\n    Strengthening the security of our clean water and \\nwastewater systems is a complex task. But it starts with \\ninformation. That is why the Water Information Sharing and \\nAnalysis Center, or Water ISAC, is so important.\\n    Mr. Hayman, can you briefly explain to the Committee the \\nbenefits of Water ISAC for water utilities, information sharing \\nfor utilities?\\n    Mr. Hayman. The old adage that information is power comes \\nto mind. Basically, the Water ISAC, by being a member of that \\norganization, information regarding cybersecurity or weather \\nissues, climate change issues, all come to one depository. So \\nit is gathered, it is analyzed, it is distributed. It ends up \\nhelping those who are members of it in being able to make \\nanalyses and make the right decisions.\\n    After the recent train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, \\nWater ISAC disseminated a bevy of information to nearby \\ncommunities about risks to water quality and protective actions \\nthey could take. So it really gives them real time information, \\nand again, information is power.\\n    Senator Markey. Thank you. Absolutely.\\n    Last week, I introduced the Water System Threat \\nPreparedness and Resilience Act, which would provide funding \\nfor clean water and wastewater utilities to become members of \\nWater ISAC. My legislation fills the critical funding gap for \\nsmall water utilities to join this critical information sharing \\nnetwork and helps expand access to essential resources.\\n    Mr. Hayman, do you agree that Congress should pass the \\nlegislation so that we should increase the information sharing, \\nsmaller utilities gain access to this information as well?\\n    Mr. Hayman. Absolutely. Absolutely, because the more \\norganizations are able to have access to it, the better we are \\nable to protect the health and safety of everyone.\\n    Senator Markey. So these small water agencies, they deserve \\nthat same kind of information?\\n    Mr. Hayman. Absolutely. Because often, they are left out, \\nand they need it the most. So anything that opens up that door \\nof opportunity, we should do.\\n    Senator Markey. Exactly. And what we just saw in East \\nPalestine, it is a small community that had a terrible \\ndisaster.\\n    Mr. Hayman. Absolutely.\\n    Senator Markey. So we don't need small water systems left \\nout, because they serve populations that could have the same \\nkind of catastrophic circumstances. So thank you for protecting \\nour infrastructure.\\n    Samuel Taylor Coleridge in a poem said, ``Water, water, \\neverywhere, but not a drop to drink.'' And Coleridge was right; \\nwe all have a thirst for clean and safe drinking water. Yet too \\nmany Americans go without access to it in the wake of aging \\npipes and monitoring systems nationwide. Small and \\ndisadvantaged communities face additional barriers to safe \\ndrinking water without the support needed to overcome them. \\nCommunities of color are 40 percent more likely to have \\ndrinking water systems that consistently fail to meet safety \\nstandards in our country.\\n    To address that clog in the system, in 2019 I introduced \\nthe CLEAR Act, legislation to provide more support for \\ndisadvantaged communities with additional financial assistance \\nfor new provisions, allowing communities to purchase filters, \\nhire technical expertise. And I was very glad to see these key \\nprovisions included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\\n    Thanks to the leadership of our Chair and our bipartisan \\nwork with the Administration, this funding and other resources \\nare getting out the door and into our pipes. More than $10 \\nmillion in EPA funding has been awarded, for example, to Fall \\nRiver, Massachusetts, after decades of neglect, to help remove \\nlead service lines throughout the city.\\n    Mr. Hayman, will more appropriated funds for the small, \\nunderserved, and disadvantaged communities grant program help \\nmore of those communities to get the safe drinking water which \\nthey are entitled to as well as the large cities?\\n    Mr. Hayman. Absolutely. And it is because the needs of our \\nwater utilities are large and expanding. They do not simply \\nstop; they are not stagnant. For example, in the last 15 years, \\nwe have had about 700 water main breaks. In the last 5 years, \\nthere have been about 4,000 water main breaks. They need to be \\nrepaired. We have, again, with our Water Revitalization Plan, \\nwe have to basically tear down one treatment plant and rebuild \\nit.\\n    So these are expensive projects that need to be done, \\nbecause so much of our system is at the end of life. If we are \\nable to receive any grants; that helps. Any moneys that we \\nreceive allow us to lessen the burden that is placed on our \\ncitizens, our customers.\\n    Senator Markey. So only $30 million was appropriated last \\nyear for small and disadvantaged communities, even though $60 \\nmillion was authorized in the Bipartisan Law. So we have to \\nwork harder. We have to get that money so that the smaller \\ncommunities, the disadvantaged communities in our country, get \\nthe protections that they deserve for their water supply as \\nwell.\\n    Thank you all so much for all your work.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Hayman.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Carper. Senator Markey, thank you. You have a lot \\ngoing on today. Thank you for making time to be here, and for \\nall of your work on this legislation.\\n    I want to close by thanking each of you for joining us. \\nSome who came from as far away as Philadelphia, just up the \\nroad from where my family and I live, and some who came from my \\nnative State of West Virginia, and we are delighted, and one \\nwho came from one of the great football venues. If I had time \\nto ask one more question, I would ask you the future of Aaron \\nRodgers on the Green Bay Packers. But we don't have time for \\nthat, we can talk later.\\n    But on a more serious note, I want to say this is a serious \\nissue, as you know. People ask me why we concentrate a lot on \\nwater in this Committee. Without water, we don't have anything, \\nwe don't have life, we don't have a good quality of life. It is \\njust incredibly important for our planet and for all of us who \\nare fortunate enough to share this planet.\\n    Speaking of shared, there is a shared responsibility with \\nrespect to providing water sanitation, wastewater sanitation, \\nclean drinking water. It is not all on the Federal Government, \\nit is not on the State and local governments, it is not just \\nall on the utilities, it is not just on customers, those of us \\nwho drink and use the water. It is a shared responsibility. We \\nall have a role to play.\\n    Our hope is with the implementation of the Bipartisan Water \\nand Wastewater legislation that we passed that we are going to \\nbe doing a better job at the Federal level of meeting our \\nresponsibilities on this front.\\n    Senators are going to be allowed to submit written \\nquestions for the record. They are going to be allowed to do \\nthat by 4 p.m. on Wednesday, March 29th, which is about 2 weeks \\nfrom today. And we will compile those questions, we will send \\nthem on to each of you, and ask you to try to respond to them, \\nif you will, be Wednesday, April 12th. If you could do that for \\nus we would be most grateful.\\n    Additionally, we received a number of statements for the \\nrecord from a wide range of stakeholders. And I would ask \\nunanimous consent at this time to enter these statements into \\nthe record.\\n    I like to make unanimous consent requests when I am the \\nonly Senator in the room, because the only person who could \\nobject is me, and I never object to my own unanimous consent \\nrequests. That would be a first that you would witness, but you \\nare not going to see it today.\\n    [The referenced information follows:]\\n    \\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n    \\n    Senator Carper. On a serious note, my mom passed away a \\nnumber of years ago, from West Virginia, born right outside of \\nBeckley in Raleigh County. My mom was a deeply religious woman. \\nShe used to drag my sister and me to church very close to where \\nwe lived in Beaver, right outside of Beckley, she would drag us \\nto church every Sunday morning, every Sunday night, every \\nWednesday night, and most Thursday nights. People say, do they \\nhave church on Thursday nights? Well, we did in Beaver more \\noften than not. Then she would take us home and we would watch \\nBilly Graham on TV.\\n    So one of the things my mom was really intent on instilling \\nin my sister Sheila and me was the Golden Rule, treat other \\npeople the way we want to be treated, which is really what we \\ntry to do with this legislation. The other thing, a real focus \\non Matthew 25, looking out for the least of these, when I was \\nthirsty, did you give me to drink.\\n    So I think we have touched a lot of bases here today, but \\neven some scriptural. I want to close with the idea that there \\nis a moral responsibility here as well. It is just not an \\neconomic imperative, a nice to do imperative, there is a moral \\nimperative here. And I think we are all trying to, regardless \\nof what our faith is, I think we are all trying to meet and \\nreach that moral imperative.\\n    We thank you very much for being a part of all that. With \\nthat, I look forward to seeing at least one of you up in \\nPhiladelphia, and another back in West Virginia, and I maybe am \\ngoing to have to go to another Packers football game. I will \\nnever forget that spring training. I have been to a bunch of \\nEagles games over the years; I thought those fans were pretty \\nrabid. But not nearly as excited as the folks were in Green \\nBay, at an exhibition game.\\n    With that, this is a wrap. We are adjourned. Thank you all \\nvery much.\\n    [Whereupon, at 12:27 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]\\n\\n                                 [all]\""

The best thing to do is to ensure that only a single OpenMP runtime is linked into the process, e.g. by avoiding static linking of the OpenMP runtime in any library. As an unsafe, unsupported, undocumented workaround you can set the environment variable KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE to allow the program to continue to execute, but that may cause crashes or silently produce incorrect results.
